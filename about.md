## About 🤙

**Hey 👋 - I'm Andre.** I'm passionate about machine learning 🤖 and better understanding the "black box" that is neural networks. By better understanding implicit biases and the thinking processes 🧠 of deep learning models, we will better be able to use it in our society.

📑 My resume is [here](https://andre-ye.github.io/scripts/andre-ye-resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
