## About 🤙

**Hey 👋 - I'm Andre.** I'm passionate about machine learning and better understanding the "black box" that is the neural network. By better understanding implicit biases and the thinking processes of deep learning models, I believe we will better be able to use it in our society.

📑 My resume is [here](https://andre-ye.github.io/scripts/andre-ye-resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

🔗 Connect with me on LinkedIn [here](https://linkedin.com/in/andre-ye){:target="_blank"}.

🖨️ Some of my favorite papers:
- [The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635v1){:target="_blank"}.
- [What’s Hidden in a Randomly Weighted Neural Network?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.13299.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
- [Scaling description of generalization with number of parameters in deep learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.01608.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
- [Reconciling modern machine learning practice and the bias-variance trade-off](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.11118.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
- [Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530){:target="_blank"}.

In the mean-time, I like to swim 🏊‍, read 📚, and play piano 🎹.

### Data Science Articles & Writing 📰 📈
I write articles about machine learning, data science, and occasionally mathematics [here](https://andre-ye.medium.com/){:target="_blank"}. Some of my favorite articles:

- [The Fascinating No-Gradient Approach to Neural Net Optimization](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-fascinating-no-gradient-approach-to-neural-net-optimization-abb287f88c97){:target="_blank"}

I've also guest-written on other platforms, including [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/01/ultimate-scikit-learn-machine-learning-cheatsheet.html){:target="_blank"}, [Netpune.ai](https://neptune.ai/blog/author/andre-ye){:target="_blank"}, and [Experfy](https://www.experfy.com/blog/author/andre-ye/){:target="_blank"}, among other platforms.

Two of my articles on KDnuggets, an organization that awards the "Nobel Prize of Data Science" - the SIGKDD award - with 700+ visitors, recieved silver and gold badges for being top-viewed and top-shared on the platform.

*Fun fact:* One of my articles was cited as a reference for a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightGBM){:target="_blank"} on the LGM gradient boosting framework.

*Fun fact:* A few of my articles have been translated into other languages, like [this one](https://www.infoq.cn/article/qUhqVdHxC0uxPFyDbt7h){:target="_blank"} on adversarial attacks using input perbutations to convolutional neural networks.

*Fun fact:* The University of Delaware Masters in Data Science Program [listed](https://www.msds.udel.edu/resources/data-resources/){:target="_blank"} an article I wrote on built-in datasets in APIs as a data resource.

### Projects

⌨️ Check out [Critiq](https://critiq.tech){:target="_blank"}, a site [Carter Chan-Nui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carterchannui/){:target="_blank"}, [Om Shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/om-shah-5a0b571ab/){:target="_blank"}, and I coded to reimagine what peer revision for essays can be and do.
