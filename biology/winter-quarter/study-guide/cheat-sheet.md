## Terms and Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| allolactose | A variant of lactose that acts as an inducer of transcription, binding to the lac repressor to prevent it from blocking RNA polymerase. |
| cAMP | Cyclic AMP allows CAP to bind and promote transcription in the lac operon. |
| catabolite activator protein (CAP) | A protein that exhibits positive control on many operons in *E. coli* and is transcribed & transcripted constitutively. CAP binds to a regulatory sequence of DNA and increases the frequency of initiating transcription by promoting the association of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme w/ the promote. |
| catabolite repression | Catabolite repression is an important part of the control system of bacteria; it inhibits synthesis of enzymes involved in the catabolism of carbon sources other than the preferred one. For instance, glucose initiated catabolite repression. |
|	constitutive | A gene is transcribed *constitutively* if it is done so without regards for gene expression control, like enzymes required for glycolysis. |
|	constitutive mutants | Cells that produce a product consistently at all times, instead of regulating its expressions. |
|	disaccharide | A sugar with two monosaccharide residues. For instance, lactose is a disaccharide, consisting of galactose and glucose. |
|	galactose | The monosaccharide sugar that, with lactose, forms lactose. |
|	gene expression | The "expression" of genes, or the transfer of information into the genotype into physical qualities of the phenotype. |
|	genetic screen | A technique used to identify and select individuals with a particular phenotype in a population with mutants. (Rephrased: Any technique that identifies individuals with a particular type of mutation.) |
|	global gene regulation | Bacteria may need to coordinate change globally instead of individual genes or operons. Global gene regulation is the coordinated regulation of many genes, across operons. |
|	glucose monosaccharide | Glucose is a monosaccharide sugar that is required for cellular respiration to produce ATP. Together with galactose, it forms the disaccharide lactose. |
| inducer | An inducer is a small molecule that triggers the transcription of a gene. It can disable repressors or bind to activators, and therefore allows transcription to start. |
| lac operon | Genes involved in lactose metabolism form the lac operon. |
| `lacI` | A gene that prevents the transcription of `lacZ` and `lacY` when lactose is absent. It acts as a negative regulator, and lactose acts as an inducer. `lacI` produces a repressor protein that binds to DNA and overlaps the promoter for `lacZ` and `lacY` genes, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing. However, lactose binds to it and changes its shape, causing this repressor to release from its binding site. |
| `lacI+` |
| lactose | A dissacharide sugar that can be broken down into the monosaccharide sugars galactose and glucose. |
| `lacY` | A gene part of the lac operon that codes for galactosidase permease, which transports lactose iell. |
| `lacY+` |
| `lacZ` |
| `lacZ+` |
