## Terms and Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| allolactose | A variant of lactose that acts as an inducer of transcription, binding to the lac repressor to prevent it from blocking RNA polymerase. |
| cAMP | Cyclic AMP allows CAP to bind and promote transcription in the lac operon. |
| catabolite activator protein (CAP) | A protein that exhibits positive control on many operons in *E. coli* and is transcribed & transcripted constitutively. CAP binds to a regulatory sequence of DNA and increases the frequency of initiating transcription by promoting the association of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme w/ the promote.
