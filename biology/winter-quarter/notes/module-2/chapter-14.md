### Introduction
- **Gregor Mendel** - an Austrian monk that laid the groundwork for the chromosome theory of inheritance.
- Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri linked the discovery of meiosis with Mendel's discovery to form the **chromosome theory of inheritance**.
  - States genes are located on chromosomes, and transmission of chromosomes to daughter cells accounts for patterns of inheritance.
- Launched the theroy of **genetics**, which concerns the inheritance of traits.

### 14.1: Medel's Experimental System
- Questions about **heredity** (inheritance) were a primary concern.
- **Trait** - any observable characteristic about an individual.

#### What Questions Was Mendel Trying to Answer?
- What are patterns of the transmsion of traits from parents to offspring?
- Two hypotheses at the time:

| Hypothesis | Description | Prediction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blending inheritance hypothesis | Traits of a mother and father blend together to form traits in offspring. | Black sheep and white sheep produce gray baby sheep. |
| Inheritance of acquired characters hypothesis | Traits are modified through use, then passed on from parents to offspring in modified form. | A giraffe that strains their necks by reaching leaves will also have babies with longer necks. |

#### The Garden Pea Served as the First Model Organism in Genetics
- Mendel chose the garden pea (*Pisum sativum*) to investigate.
  - **Model organism** - species used for research b/c it is easy to work with, and conclusions drawn from it may apply to other species.
  - Mendel could control which parents were involved in mating.
  - A **polymorphic trait** is one that appears commonly in 2+ forms.
    - e.g. purple or white flowers.
- **How did Mendel control matings?**
  - Garden pea flowers have male and female reproductive structures.
    - Usually undergo **self-fertilization** - flower's pollen falls into female reproductive organ of the same flower.
  - Mendel prevented self-fertilization by removing male reproductive organs before pollen formed, then transfered pollen from another pea plant.
    - This is **cross-fertilization**, or just a **cross**.
- **What traits did Mendel study?**
  - **Phenotype** - observable traits of an individual.
  - Mendel used peas that differed in seven phenotypes.
  - **Pure line** - individuals that produce offspring identical to the parents when they are crossed to another member of the same population, or are self-fertilized.
    - Predictable pure lines can be used such that a new phenotype is the result of a cross, rather than some random event.
  - Offspring with matings between true-breeding parents that differ in one or more traits: **hybrids**.

### 14.2: Mendel's Experiments with a Single Trait
- In his first set of experiments, Mendel crossed pure liens of garden peas that differed in only one trait.
- Crossed round-seed individuals and wrinkle-seed individuals (from pure lins).
  - Individuals used in initial cross: **parental generation**.
  - Progeny (offspring) are **F1 generation**, "first filial".
    - Latin *filius* and *filia* mean "son" and "daughter".
  - Continues as *F2* generation, *F3*, so on.

#### The Monohybrid Cross: Dominant and Recessive Traits, A Reciprocal Cross, Do Mendel's Results Hold for Other Traits?
- Mendel took pollen from plants in the round-seed land and placed it on female reproductive organs for plants from the wrinkle-seed line.
  - All seeds produced from this cross were *round*.
- Result:
  - Traits did not blend together to form an intermediate phenotype, but only the round-seed trait appeared.
    - This contradicts the blending-inheritance hypotheiss.
  - The wrinkle-seed trait disappeared.

Dominant and Recessive Traits
- Mendel planted the F1 seeds and allowed the pea plants to self-fertilize when they matured.
  - Each of the F1 plants inherited a genetic determinant for round and wrinkled seeds each.
  - **Monohybrid cross**: parents that each carry two different genetic determinants for the same trait.
  - Produces a hybrid for a single trait.
- When F2 seeds were analyzed, results were:
  - 5474 round
  - 1850 wrinkled
- Wrinkle-seed shape disappeared in the F1 generation but reappeared in the F2 generation.
- Results:
  - Wrinkled shape is **recessive** because this phenotype recedes, or seems to be hidden.
  - Round shape is **domiannt** because it dominates over the wrinkle-seed determinant when both are present.
- Genetics: "dominant" and "recessive" refer to which phenotype is observed and which is masked when individuals carry two different genetic determinants for a trait.
- Ratio is 3:1.

A Reciprocal Cross
- Does the male or female parent have a particular genetic determinant?
- Performed a second set of crosses between two pure-line populations.
  - "In reverse" - used pollen from pure line of wrinkle-seed peas on the round peas.
  - This is a **reciprocal cross**; set of matings where the mother's phenotype is the initial cross and the father's is second, and vice versa.
- Results are **identical**; all F1 progeny had round seeds.
- Sometimes, reciprocal crosses do produce different results.

Do Mendel's Results Hold for Other Traits?
- Mendel established results of crosses with 6 other traits.
- Important patterns:
  - F1 progeny only showed the dominant trait.
  - Reciprocal crosses produced the same results.
  - Ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes in the F2-generation was 3:1.

### Particulate Inheritance: Genes, Alleles, and Genotypes
- Mendel proposed a hypothesis: **particulate inheritance**.
  - Hereditary determinants for traits to not blend together or become modified through use.
  - Hereditary determinants maintain their integrity, and act as discrete, unchanging particles.
