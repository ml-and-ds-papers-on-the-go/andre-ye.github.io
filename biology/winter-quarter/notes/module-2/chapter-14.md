### Introduction
- **Gregor Mendel** - an Austrian monk that laid the groundwork for the chromosome theory of inheritance.
- Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri linked the discovery of meiosis with Mendel's discovery to form the **chromosome theory of inheritance**.
  - States genes are located on chromosomes, and transmission of chromosomes to daughter cells accounts for patterns of inheritance.
- Launched the theroy of **genetics**, which concerns the inheritance of traits.

### 14.1: Medel's Experimental System
- Questions about **heredity** (inheritance) were a primary concern.
- **Trait** - any observable characteristic about an individual.

#### What Questions Was Mendel Trying to Answer?
- What are patterns of the transmsion of traits from parents to offspring?
- Two hypotheses at the time:

| Hypothesis | Description | Prediction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Blending inheritance hypothesis | Traits of a mother and father blend together to form traits in offspring. | Black sheep and white sheep produce gray baby sheep. |
| Inheritance of acquired characters hypothesis | Traits are modified through use, then passed on from parents to offspring in modified form. | A giraffe that strains their necks by reaching leaves will also have babies with longer necks. |

#### The Garden Pea Served as the First Model Organism in Genetics
- Mendel chose the garden pea (*Pisum sativum*) to investigate.
  - **Model organism** - species used for research b/c it is easy to work with, and conclusions drawn from it may apply to other species.
  - Mendel could control which parents were involved in mating.
  - A **polymorphic trait** is one that appears commonly in 2+ forms.
    - e.g. purple or white flowers.
- **How did Mendel control matings?**
  - Garden pea flowers have male and female reproductive structures.
    - Usually undergo **self-fertilization** - flower's pollen falls into female reproductive organ of the same flower.
  - Mendel prevented self-fertilization by removing male reproductive organs before pollen formed, then transfered pollen from another pea plant.
    - This is **cross-fertilization**, or just a **cross**.
- **What traits did Mendel study?**
  - **Phenotype** - observable traits of an individual.
  - Mendel used peas that differed in seven phenotypes.
  - **Pure line** - individuals that produce offspring identical to the parents when they are crossed to another member of the same population, or are self-fertilized.
    - Predictable pure lines can be used such that a new phenotype is the result of a cross, rather than some random event.
  - Offspring with matings between true-breeding parents that differ in one or more traits: **hybrids**.

### 14.2: Mendel's Experiments with a Single Trait
- In his first set of experiments, Mendel crossed pure liens of garden peas that differed in only one trait.
- Crossed round-seed individuals and wrinkle-seed individuals (from pure lins).
  - Individuals used in initial cross: **parental generation**.
  - Progeny (offspring) are **F1 generation**, "first filial".
    - Latin *filius* and *filia* mean "son" and "daughter".
  - Continues as *F2* generation, *F3*, so on.

#### The Monohybrid Cross: Dominant and Recessive Traits; A Reciprocal Cross; Do Mendel's Results Hold for Other Traits?
- Mendel took pollen from plants in the round-seed land and placed it on female reproductive organs for plants from the wrinkle-seed line.
  - All seeds produced from this cross were *round*.
- Result:
  - Traits did not blend together to form an intermediate phenotype, but only the round-seed trait appeared.
    - This contradicts the blending-inheritance hypotheiss.
  - The wrinkle-seed trait disappeared.

*Dominant and Recessive Traits*
- Mendel planted the F1 seeds and allowed the pea plants to self-fertilize when they matured.
  - Each of the F1 plants inherited a genetic determinant for round and wrinkled seeds each.
  - **Monohybrid cross**: parents that each carry two different genetic determinants for the same trait.
  - Produces a hybrid for a single trait.
- When F2 seeds were analyzed, results were:
  - 5474 round
  - 1850 wrinkled
- Wrinkle-seed shape disappeared in the F1 generation but reappeared in the F2 generation.
- Results:
  - Wrinkled shape is **recessive** because this phenotype recedes, or seems to be hidden.
  - Round shape is **domiannt** because it dominates over the wrinkle-seed determinant when both are present.
- Genetics: "dominant" and "recessive" refer to which phenotype is observed and which is masked when individuals carry two different genetic determinants for a trait.
- Ratio is 3:1.

*A Reciprocal Cross*
- Does the male or female parent have a particular genetic determinant?
- Performed a second set of crosses between two pure-line populations.
  - "In reverse" - used pollen from pure line of wrinkle-seed peas on the round peas.
  - This is a **reciprocal cross**; set of matings where the mother's phenotype is the initial cross and the father's is second, and vice versa.
- Results are **identical**; all F1 progeny had round seeds.
- Sometimes, reciprocal crosses do produce different results.

*Do Mendel's Results Hold for Other Traits?*
- Mendel established results of crosses with 6 other traits.
- Important patterns:
  - F1 progeny only showed the dominant trait.
  - Reciprocal crosses produced the same results.
  - Ratio of dominant to recessive phenotypes in the F2-generation was 3:1.

#### Particulate Inheritance: Genes, Alleles, and Genotypes; The Principle of Segregation; Mendel's Claims to Explain the Monohybrid Cross
- Mendel proposed a hypothesis: **particulate inheritance**.
  - Hereditary determinants for traits to not blend together or become modified through use.
  - Hereditary determinants maintain their integrity, and act as discrete, unchanging particles.

*Genes, Alleles, and Genotypes*
- **Gene**: hereditary determinant of a trait.
  - Mendel proposed each individual can have two versions of any gene: **alleles**.
  - Combination of alleles in an individual: **genotype**.
- Hypothesis that pea plants have two copies of each gene comes from the need to explain why a trait can disappear in one generation and pop up in another.
  - If each individual carries 2 alleles and one is dominant over another, in a hybrid, the recessive trait will be hidden.
  - When F1 hybrids are crossed, some F2 offspring may inherit two copies of the recessive allele.

*The Principle of Segregation*
- Two members of each gene pair must segregate (separate) into different gamete cells during the formation of eggs and sperm.
  - Each gamete has one allele of each gene: **principle of segregation**.
- Modelling the segregation of alleles:
  - *R* = dominant allele, *r* = recessive allele.
  - *RR* and *rr* are **homozygous** - always produce offspring with the same phenotype because they are homozygous.
  - *Rr* and *rR* are **heterozygous** - having different alleles.
- Punnett square modelling (assuming heterozygous mother and father):

| | *Mother 1/2 chance **R*** | *Mother 1/2 chance **r*** |
| *Father 1/2 chance **R*** | *1/4 chance **RR*** | *1/4 chance **Rr*** |
| *Father 1/2 chance **r*** | *1/4 chance **Rr*** | *1/4 chance **rr*** |

- This yields a 3:1 ratio in the F2 generation.

*Mendel's Claims to Explain the Monohybrid Cross*
1. Peas have two copies of each gene, and thus may have two different alleles of the gene.
2. Genes are particles of inheritance that do not blend together.
3. Each gamete contains one copy of each gene (allele).
4. Males and females contribute equally to the genotype of offspring.
5. Some alelles are more dominant than others.
