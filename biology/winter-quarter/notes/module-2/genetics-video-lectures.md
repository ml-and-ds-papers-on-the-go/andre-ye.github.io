### Crash Course Biology: Heredity
Access [here](https://kcts9.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/0780890c-f38e-4956-aa8a-89ddd10d6379/heredity-crash-course-biology-9/){:target="_blank"}
- Heredity is the passing of genetic springs from parent to offspring.
- Concept of reproduction from Aristotle: suggested that we are a mixture of our parents' traits.
- Austrian monk: Gregor Mendel, demonstrated inheritance followed certain laws.
- By crossing pea plants and seeing which got passed on, he came up with a framework for how genes are inherited.
- Chromosomes: the form DNA takes to get passed onf rom parent to child.
- Gene: a section of DNA on a chromosome to determine a trait.
  - Polygenic trait: controlled by multiple genes.
  - Pleitropic trait: a gene that controls many traits are expressed.
  - Mendelian trait: a gene that controls exactly one trait.
- An allele is a version of a gene.
- Any cell that isn't a sperm or egg cell are somatic diploid cells.
  - Gametes are haploid cells (one set of chromosomes) that, during fertilization, form diploid cells.
- Some cells are polyploid: they have more than one version of each gene.
- When there are two alleles that decide the outcome of a certain trait, one is dominant and the other is recessive.
- Reginald C. Punnett: created the Punnett square to diagram results of crosses.
- Sex-linked inheritance
  - 22 pairs of autosomes, and the 23rd pair is the sex chromosome.
  - Women have two X chromosomes, and men have an X chromosome and a smaller Y chromosome.
  - There may be recessive alleles on the X chromosome that is expressed in males because there is no corresponding allele in the Y chromosome to dominate it.
