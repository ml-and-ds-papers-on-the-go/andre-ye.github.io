### Chapter 22.1: The Rise of Evolutionary Thouhgt
- People describe the theory of evolution by natural selection as revolutionary.
  - Overturning an existing idea about how nature works; replace it with a radically different idea.
- Advance of theory of evolution represents a profound scientific revolution.

#### Plato and Typological Thinking
- Plato claimed every organism was a perfect essence or type created by God, unchanging.
- Small variations are trivial deviations from perfect essence.
- Typological thinking - a divine being creates each type of organism.

#### Aristotle and the Scale of Nature
- One of Plato's students, Aristotle, organized typological thinking into a scale of nature.
  - Begins with minerals and plants, rises through higher plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, humans.
- Aristotle's ideas remained popular into the 1700s.

#### Lamarck and the Idea of Evolution as Change through Time
- 1809, biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck proposed **evolution** - species are not static but change through time.
- Lamarck claimed simple organisms evolve by moving up Aristotle's scale over time.
- Lamarckian evolution always produces larger and more complex species.
- Claimed that species change via inheritance of acquired characters - phenotype changes in response to challenges posed by the environment.

#### Darwin and Wallace and Evolution by Natural Seelction
- Lamarck eventually abandoned the linear and progressive way of life.
- Darwin claimed that variation among individuals in a population is chief in understanding the nature of species - **population thinking**.
- Theory of evolution by natural selection is sigificant because:
  1. Overturns the idea that species are static and unchanging.
  2. Replaces typological thinking with population thinking.
  3. Was scientific.
