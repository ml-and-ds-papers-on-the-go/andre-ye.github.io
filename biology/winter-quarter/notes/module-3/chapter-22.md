### Chapter 22.1: The Rise of Evolutionary Thouhgt
- People describe the theory of evolution by natural selection as revolutionary.
  - Overturning an existing idea about how nature works; replace it with a radically different idea.
- Advance of theory of evolution represents a profound scientific revolution.

#### Plato and Typological Thinking
- Plato claimed every organism was a perfect essence or type created by God, unchanging.
- Small variations are trivial deviations from perfect essence.
- Typological thinking - a divine being creates each type of organism.

#### Aristotle and the Scale of Nature
- One of Plato's students, Aristotle, organized typological thinking into a scale of nature.
  - Begins with minerals and plants, rises through higher plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, humans.
- Aristotle's ideas remained popular into the 1700s.

#### Lamarck and the Idea of Evolution as Change through Time
- 1809, biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck proposed **evolution** - species are not static but change through time.
- Lamarck claimed simple organisms evolve by moving up Aristotle's scale over time.
- Lamarckian evolution always produces larger and more complex species.
- Claimed that species change via inheritance of acquired characters - phenotype changes in response to challenges posed by the environment.

#### Darwin and Wallace and Evolution by Natural Seelction
- Lamarck eventually abandoned the linear and progressive way of life.
- Darwin claimed that variation among individuals in a population is chief in understanding the nature of species - **population thinking**.
- Theory of evolution by natural selection is sigificant because:
  1. Overturns the idea that species are static and unchanging.
  2. Replaces typological thinking with population thinking.
  3. Was scientific.

### Chapter 22.2: The Pattern of Evolution - Have Species Changed, and Are They Related?
- **Descent with modification** - species change through time, and species are related by common ancestry.

#### Evidence for Change Through Time
- **Fossil** - trace of any organism that has lived in the past.
- **Fossil record** - all fossils that have been found on Earth.
- **Extant species** - secpies living today.

| Evidence | Description |
| --- | --- |
| the vastness of geologic time | James Hutton principle of uniformitarianism - geological processes occuring today are similar to those of the past. **Geologic time scale** - a sequence of named intervals called eons, eras, and periods that represent major events in Earth history. Radioactive decay functions as a "natural clock". Using radiometric dating, Earth is about 4.6 billion years old. |
| extinction changes the species present over time | Some species have gone extinct; large, distinctive terrestrial animals would have been found if they were not extinct. Species are not static, immutable entities. 99% of all species that have lived are extinct. |
| transitional features link older and younger species | A **transitional feature** - trait in fossil species that is intermediate between an ancestral and derived species. Sequences of transitional features document changes in evolution. Individual fossils of transitional reforms are not necessarily direct ancestors of later species, though. |
| vestigial traits are evidence of change over time | **Vestigial trait** - reduiced or incompletely developed structure that has no function. A vestigial trait may have been beneficial, but would be less beneficial depending on environmental factors. |
| species can be observed changing today | Evolution can be observed in the scale of days, weeks, and months. |

#### Evidence of Descent from a Common Ancestor

| Evidence | Description |
| --- | --- |
| similar species are found in the same geographic area | Many finches that were similar ocurred in the same geographic area; finches were similar because they had descended from the same common ancestor. DNA sequence comparisons enable researchers to place species on a phylogenetic trees, confirming this. |
| formation of new species from preexisting species can be observed today | Many contemporary populations are undergoing *speciation* - a process that results in the formation of new species. Powerful evidence that species living today are descendants of species that lived in the past. |
| related species share homologies | **Homology** - the study of likeness, a similarity that exists in species due to common ancestry (e.g. human hair and dog fur). Theory of evolution predicts homology would occur. |

#### Levels of Homology

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| genetic | Similarity in DNA, RNA, or amino acid sequences. |
| developmental | Similarity in embyronic form or developmental processes. |
| structural | Similarity in adult organismal structures, morphology. |

#### Evolution's Internal Consistency - The Importance of Independent Datasets
- Internal consistency - independent sources agree on supporting predictions made by a theory.
- For examples, whales seem to have evolved from terrestrial animals.
  - fossil record
  - phylogeny of fossil cetaceans
  - relative dating - order of species agrees with phylogeny
  - absolute dating - agrees with relative dating
  - phylogeny of living whales and dolphins - hippos are related to whales
  - vestigial hip and hindlimb bones - occur in some dolphin embyros too
- No single observation or experiment proves evolution; data from many different sources can be more consistent with one theory rather than another.
