### Introduction
- Understanding evolution - change in heritable traits - is essential to understanding ourselves and the organisms around us.
- Fruits of modern synthesis was **population** genetics - study of processes that change allele and genotype frequencies in popultions.
- Evolution is now understood to be driven by 4 processes:
  - **Natural selection** increases the frequency of certain alleles.
  - **Genetic drift** causes allele frequencies to change randomly.
  - **Gene flow** occurs when individuals leave one population, join another, and breed.
  - **Mutation** modifies allele frequencies by introducing new alleles.
- Fundamental ideas:
  - Natural selection is not the only process responsible for evolution.
  - Each of the four evolutionary processes has different consequences for genetic variation and fitness.

### 23.1: Null Hypothesis - The Hardy-Weinberg Principle
- 1908; G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg published major results.
  - Common believed that changes in allele frequency were simply the result of sexual reproduction (meiosis and random fusion of gametes).
  - Do dominant alleles increase in frequency when gametes combine at random?
- Hardy and Weinberg analyzed frequencies of alleles when many individuals in a population mate to produce offspring.

#### The Gene Pool Concept
- Hardy and Weinberg imagined a scenario in which all alleles from gametes produced in each generation go into a gene pool.
- Hardy and Weinberg calculated what would happen if pairs of gametes were randomly combined in this gene pool.
- For example, consider a gene pool with frequencies `0.7` *A* and `0.3` *a*.

| | `0.7` *A* | `0.3` *a* |
| `0.7` *A* | `0.49` *AA* | `0.21` *Aa* |
| `0.3` *a* | `0.21` *Aa* | `0.09` *aa* |

- **Hardy-Weinberg principle makes two claims:**
  1. If frequencies of alleles *A* and *a* are given by `p` and `q`, then the frequencies of genotypes *AA*, *Aa*, and *aa* are given by `p^2`, `2pq`, and `q^2`.
  2. When alleles are merely transmitted via meiosis and random combinations of gametes, their frequencies do not change over time.
    - Allele frequencies are the same in the next generation. (percent of offspring gametes that have gamete `A` can be calculated as `0.49 + (0.21/2) + (0.21/2) = 0.7`.)
- Given a set of parental allele frequencies, the Hardy-Weinberg principle predicts **what genotype frequencies** and **allele frequencies** will occur.
  - However, **allele frequencies do often change over time** in real populations.

#### The Hardy-Weinberg Principle Makes Important Assumptions
- Five important assumptions about how populations and alelles behave:
  1. **Random mating**. Individuals are not allowed to choose a mate.
  2. **No natural selection**. All members of the parental generation survive, regardless of genotype.
  3. **No genetic drift (random allele frequency changes)**. The model assumes alleles are picked by their exact frequencies *p* and *q*, and not by chance.
  4. **No gene flow**. No new alleles are added by immigration or lost through emigration.
  5. **No mutation**. No new alleles are introduced to the gene pool.
- Nonrandom mating can cause genotype frequencies to change, not allele frequencies; they need to work in tandem wth other forces to change allele frequencies.
- The other four factors are processes of evolution - they change allele frequencies.

### 23.2: Nonrandom Mating
- In the Hardy-Weinberg model, gametes are picked from the gene pool at random and paired to create offspring genotypes.
- Matings between individuals in nature may not be random, though.
- **Inbreeding** - mating between relatives.

#### How Does Inbreeding Affect Allele Frequencies and Genotype Frequencies?
- Focus on alleles *A* and *a* with equal frequencies of 0.5.
- Individuals self-fertilize - the most extreme form of inbreeding.
- Homozygous parents produce homozygous offspring; heterozygous parents produce a 1:2:1 ratio of homozygous and heterozygous offspring.
- Consider several rounds of self-fertilization across a population.
  - The homozygous proportion of the population increases with each generation, while the heterozygous population is halved.

| Generation | *AA* Homozygote | *Aa* Heterozygote | *aa* Homozygote |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 25% | 50% | 25% |
| 2 | 37.5% | 25% | 37.5% |
| 3 | 43.75% | 12.5% | 43.75% |

- Two fundamental pointsd about inbreeding are demonstrated:
  - Inbreeding increases homozygosity.
  - Inbreeding does not itself cause evolution since allele frequencies do not change in the population.
  
#### How Does Inbreeding Influence Evolution?
- Even though it may not influence evolution directly, inbreeding can speed up the rate of evolutionary change.
  - Increases the rate natural selection eliminates recessive deleterious alleles (alelles that lower fitness) from a population.
- Many recessive deleterious alleles are rare and exist in heterozygote individuals.
  - In heterozygote individuals, a deleterious effect has little effect, since a normal allele can usually produce enough functional protein to support a normal phenotype.
  - Inbreeding increases the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals, exposing the rare allele to selection.
- **Inbreeding depression** - the decline in average fitness when homozygosity increases and heterzygosity decreases.
  - Inbreeding depression is a common problem in small populations.

#### Nonrandom Mating via Sexual Selection
- Sometimes nonrandom mating occurs not due to inbreeding but because of **sexual selection** - an organism chooses a mate based on physical/behavioral traits.
- Fundamentally different from inbreeding because it does lead to changes in allele frequencies and increases fitness - thus it is a form of natural selection.

### 23.3: Natural Selection
- Evolution by natural selection occurs when heritable variation leads to differential success in survival and reproduction.
- Natural selection violates the assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg principle.
- Sexual selection is a subset of natural selection - both produce adaptation, increasing fitness.
  - Sexual and ecological selection may favor different traits.
  
#### How Does Selection Affect Genetic Variation?
- Biologists focus on **genetic variation** - the number and relative frequency of alleles in a particular population.
  - Lack of genetic variation is usually a bad thing.
- **Natural selection occurs in four main modes.**
  - *Directional selection* changes the average value of a trait.
  - *Stabilizing selection* reduces variation in a trait.
  - *Disruptive selection* increases variation in a trait.
  - *Balancing selection* maintains variation in a trait.
- **Direction selection.** The average phenotype of a population changes in one direction.
  - Tends to reduce the genetic diversity of populations.
  - When deleterious alleles decline in frequency, **purifying selection** occurs.
- **Stabilizing selection.** Reduces both extremes in a population.
  - Has two important conseqeunces:
    - Genetic variation in the population is reduced;
    - There is no change in the average value of the trait over time.
  - For example, babies that are too large or too small are more likely to die.
- **Disruptive selection.** Instead of favoring phenotypes near the average value, disruptive selection favors extreme phenotypes.
  - Overall amount of genetic variation in the population increases.
  - Disruptive selection plays a role in *speciation* - the formation of new species.
- **Balancing selection.** Occurs when no phenotype has a distinct advantage.
  - There is a balance among several phenotypes in terms of their fitness and frequency.
  - The following are most common:
    - *Heterozygote advantage* occurs when heterozygote individuals have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals.
    - *Frequency-dependent selection* occurs when alleles are favored when they are rare but not when they are common.

#### Sexual Selection
- Darwom was perplexed by seemingly nonadaptive traits like trains of peacocks.
- **intersexual selection** - selection of one individual of one sex by an individual of another sex.
  - Organisms may select traits that are honest signals of health and genetic quality.
- **intrasexual selection** - selection within a sex in which individuals of the smae sex compete with one another to obtain mates.
  - **territory** - actively defended area where the owner has exclusive or semi-exclusive use.
  - Males monopolize matings with females by winning territorial battles.
- **Bateman-Trivers hypothesis** - the *fundamental asymmetry of sex*.
  - Females invest a lot in few eggs - they protect this investment by being choosy about their mates.
    - Males that invest little in each sperm should be more willing to mate with almost any female.
  - If there are an equal number of males and females in a population, males will compete for mates.
  - If male fitness is limited by access to mates, any allele that increases a male's attractiveness should increase in a population.
    - Sexual selection acts more strongly on males than on females.
  - Sometimes, males invest more in parental care for offspring, and there male be more females than males in a population.
    - Sexual selection varies in the context of different mating strategies (some females benefit from being promiscuous while others benefit from being monogamous).
    - Sexual selection can vary in different environmental contexts.
  - *Fundamental asymmetry of sex* is not valid across all species all the time.
- **Sexual dimorphism** - "two forms", can be explained by intersexual and intrasexual selection.
  - Traits can differ between the sexes of the same species.

#### Conclusion and Main Points
- Multiple forms of sexual and/or ecological selection can occur at the same time in a population.
- Alleles responsible for adaptive morphological, physiological, and/or behavioral phenotypes increase in frequency over time. This violates assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg principle.
- Selection can change over time and space because it occurs in the complex of ecology, which is highly complex and dynamic.
