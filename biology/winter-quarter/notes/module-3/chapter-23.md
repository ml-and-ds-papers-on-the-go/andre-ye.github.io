### Introduction
- Understanding evolution - change in heritable traits - is essential to understanding ourselves and the organisms around us.
- Fruits of modern synthesis was **population** genetics - study of processes that change allele and genotype frequencies in popultions.
- Evolution is now understood to be driven by 4 processes:
  - **Natural selection** increases the frequency of certain alleles.
  - **Genetic drift** causes allele frequencies to change randomly.
  - **Gene flow** occurs when individuals leave one population, join another, and breed.
  - **Mutation** modifies allele frequencies by introducing new alleles.
- Fundamental ideas:
  - Natural selection is not the only process responsible for evolution.
  - Each of the four evolutionary processes has different consequences for genetic variation and fitness.

### 23.1: Null Hypothesis - The Hardy-Weinberg Principle
- 1908; G. H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg published major results.
  - Common believed that changes in allele frequency were simply the result of sexual reproduction (meiosis and random fusion of gametes).
  - Do dominant alleles increase in frequency when gametes combine at random?
- Hardy and Weinberg analyzed frequencies of alleles when many individuals in a population mate to produce offspring.

#### The Gene Pool Concept
- Hardy and Weinberg imagined a scenario in which all alleles from gametes produced in each generation go into a gene pool.
- Hardy and Weinberg calculated what would happen if pairs of gametes were randomly combined in this gene pool.
- For example, consider a gene pool with frequencies `0.7` *A* and `0.3` *a*.

| | `0.7` *A* | `0.3` *a* |
| `0.7` *A* | `0.49` *AA* | `0.21` *Aa* |
| `0.3` *a* | `0.21` *Aa* | `0.09` *aa* |

- **Hardy-Weinberg principle makes two claims:**
  1. If frequencies of alleles *A* and *a* are given by `p` and `q`, then the frequencies of genotypes *AA*, *Aa*, and *aa* are given by `p^2`, `2pq`, and `q^2`.
  2. When alleles are merely transmitted via meiosis and random combinations of gametes, their frequencies do not change over time.
    - Allele frequencies are the same in the next generation. (percent of offspring gametes that have gamete `A` can be calculated as `0.49 + (0.21/2) + (0.21/2) = 0.7`.)
- Given a set of parental allele frequencies, the Hardy-Weinberg principle predicts **what genotype frequencies** and **allele frequencies** will occur.
  - However, **allele frequencies do often change over time** in real populations.

#### The Hardy-Weinberg Principle Makes Important Assumptions
- Five important assumptions about how populations and alelles behave:
  1. **Random mating**. Individuals are not allowed to choose a mate.
  2. **No natural selection**. All members of the parental generation survive, regardless of genotype.
  3. **No genetic drift (random allele frequency changes)**. The model assumes alleles are picked by their exact frequencies *p* and *q*, and not by chance.
  4. **No gene flow**. No new alleles are added by immigration or lost through emigration.
  5. **No mutation**. No new alleles are introduced to the gene pool.
- Nonrandom mating can cause genotype frequencies to change, not allele frequencies; they need to work in tandem wth other forces to change allele frequencies.
- The other four factors are processes of evolution - they change allele frequencies.
