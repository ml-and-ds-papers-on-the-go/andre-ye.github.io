### BioSkills 13: Reading and Making Phylogenetic Trees
- Phylogenetic trees show hypothesized evolutionary relationships between species and other taxa.
- **Taxon** - group of organisms, like a population, species, or larger group.

| Component | Relevance |
| --- | --- |
| root | The most ancestral population, where the tree originates. |
| branches | Represents population through time. |
| nodes/forks | Occur when hypothetical ancestral groups split into multiple groups. Each node represents the most recent common ancestor of descendant populations that emerge from it. |
| tips/terminal nodes | Tree's endpoints, representing a taxon of organisms living today or in the past. |
| monophyletic group / lineage / clade | Consists of an ancestral species and *all* of its descendants. |
| trait | An *ancestral trait* is a characteristic existed in an ancestor, a shared derived trait (*synapomorphy*) can be a characteristic that is gained or lost. |
| outgroup | A taxon that is known ot have diverged from the rest of the taxa. Outgroups establish if a trait is ancestral or derived. |

### Chapter 1.4: Life Evolves
#### What is Evolution?
- Darwin and Wallace's theory made two claims:
  - Species are related by common ancestry.
  - Characteristics of species can be modified from generation to generation.
- **Evolution** - change in characteristics of a population over time.
- **Population** - defined as a group of individuals of the same species living in the same area t the smae time.

#### What is Natural Selection?
- Two conditions of natural selection:
  1. Individuals within a population vary in **heritable** characteristics.
  2. Certain versions of these traits affect the fitness of an individual.
- Natural selection acts on individuals, evolutionary change occurs in populations.
- **Speciation** - natural selection causes populations of one species to diverge and form a new species.
- **Fitness** - an individual's ability to produce viable offspring.
- **Adaptation** - a heritable trait that increases the fitness of an individual relative to individuals lacking the trait.

### Chapter 1.5: The "Tree of Life" Depicts Evolutionary History
- Biologists should be able to construct a **tree of life**.

#### Using Genetic Sequences to Understand the Tree of Life
- Carl Woese  attempted to undersand the **phylogeny** - genealogical relationships - of all organisms.
  - *phylogeny* translates to *tribe-source*.
- Genetic variation can be analyzed via mutations in DNA and RNA; a **phylogenetic tree** can be produced.
- **LUCA** - last universal common ancestor of cells.
- Tree of Life implies that there are three fundamental groups of organisms: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya.
- **Eukaryotes** - cells have a nucleus.
  - Eukaryotes are usually multicellular.
- **Prokaryotes** - do not have a nucleus (bacterial and archaeal cells).
  - Bacteria and archaea are usually unicellular.

#### How Should We Name Branches on the Tree of Life?
- **Taxonomy** - the effort to name and classify organisms.
- **Taxon** (plural: **taxa**) - any named group at any level of classification.
- **Domain** - taxonomic category encompassing the bacteria, archaea, and eukarya.
- **Phylum** (plural: **phyla**) - major lineages within each domain.
  - Within eukaryotic lineage, there are about 30-35 phyla.
- Scientific latin names consist of two parts:
  - **Genus** (plural: **genera**) - a closely related group of species.
  - **Species name** - identifies the organism's species.
  - Each scientific name is unique.
