### Introduction
- The story begins with a bacterial immune system: how do bacteria fight off an immune infection?
- Many bacteria have - in their chromosome - a sequnece of *repeats* that are interspaced with sequences that are derived from viruses.
  - These have been noticed by microbiologists sequencing bacterial genomes.
  - These also occur with a series of genes that often encode proteins that have homology to enzymes that do things like DNA repair.
- **Hypothesis** - this system (CRISPR) could actually be an acquired immune system in bacteria that might allow sequences to be integrated from viruses and used to protect the cell from infection by the same virus.

### Acquiring Immunity in Bacteria
- Right after the publication of 3 papers that pointed out the incorporation of virus sequences of these genomic loci, began studying CRISPR.
- These CRISPR systems are acquired systems in bacteria; bacteria actually had aw ay to adapt to viruses that get into the cell.
- It involves detecting foreign DNA that gets injected from a virus that gets into the cell.

| **Step** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Adaptation | The CRISPR system allows integration of short pieces of those viral DNA molecules into the CRISPR locus. |
| 2. crRNA Biogenesis | The CRISPR sequences are transcribed into pieces of RNA that are used together with proteins encoded by the CAS genes (CRISPR-associated genes) to form interference complexes. |
| 3. Interference | These interference complexes use the information in the form of RNA molecules to base-pair with matching sequences in viral DNA, disabling the virus. |

- How are RNA molecules used to help cells regulate the expression of proteins?
- Begin studying the moelcular mechanisms by which this pathway operates.

### Cas9 and Streptococcus Pyogenes
- Emmanuelle Charpentier was interested in bacteria that are human pathogens.
- Studying *streptococcus pyogenes* that is a bacterium that can cause very severe infections in humans.
- This bug has a CRISPR system; there was a single gene encoding the Cas9 protein.
  - This protein has been shown to be required for the operation of the CRISPR system for streptococcus pyogenes.
  - No one had known what the function of Cas9 was, though.

#### Cas9 Is a Dual-RNA-Guided dsDNA Endonuclease
- After experiments, discovered that **Cas9 has the ability to interact with DNA and generate a double stranded break** in DNA at sequences that match the sequence in the *guide RNA*.
- The guide RNA base pairs with one strand of the double-helical DNA.
  - This RNA interacts with tracrRNA that forms a structure that recruits the Cas9 protein.
  - These two RNAs and the protein are required for the protein to recognize what would be viral DNAs in the cell; the protien cuts these.

#### Simplifying Cas9
- Instead of two RNAs, one can link together the two RNAs to form a single-protein and single-guiding-RNA system.
- The two RNAs would be linked together to create a **single guide RNA**.

#### Programmed Cas9 Cleaves DNA at Specified Sites
- Simplee xperiment to test whether this was a programmable DNA cleaving enzyme.
- Short single-guide RNAs were generated, these recognized sites in a circular DNA molecule.
- The plasmid DNA was incubated with Sal1 and the RNA-guided Cas9.
- Results: cleaved molecules of DNA are separated in an agarose gel, and a different sized-molecule is released from a doubly-digested plasmid.
  - The size of the DNA corresponds to cleavage at different sites directed by the guide RNA sequences.
  - A programmable DNA cutting enzyme has been achieved; it can be programmed with a hsort bit of DNA.

### Genome Editing Begins with dsDNA Cleavage
- There are many experiments showing that cells have ways to repair double-stranded DNA breaks that lead to changes in the genomic information of the DNA.
- After a double-stranded break is generated by any enzyme (including Cas9), the break is detected and repaired.
  - One repair pathway involves **nonhomologous end-joining**; the ends are chemically ligated together. There is a small insertion or deletion.
  - Another repair pathway involves **homology directed repair**; a donor DNA molecule can be integrated into the genome at the site of the break to introduce new genetic information.
- If there were a tool to allow scientists or researchers to introduce double-stranded breaks at a particular site, you can edit genes.
  - For example, fix a mutation or generate a mutation in a DNA sequence.
- The power of technology: **we can generate double-stranded breaks that we choose** by programming Cas9.

### Genome Targeting Technologies
- Challenge: how to generate the breaks in the first place?

| Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) and TAL Effector Nuclease | Programmable way to generate double-stranded breaks; rely on **protein-based recognition** of DNA sequences. Proteins are modular and can be generated in different combinations to recognize different DNA sequences. **Requires a lot of protein engineering.** |
| CRISPY/Cas9 | An **RNA-programmed** nuclease; a single protein can be used with a guide RNA. |

- This is the missing piece of the "Biology IT Toolbox".
  - DNA structure/sequencing
  - Restriction enzymes
  - Polymerase Chain Reaction
  - **Genome Editing** - enabling facile genome editing!

### Summary: CRISPR-Cas9 Technology and Applications
- A 2-component system that relies on RNA-DNA base pairing for recognition.
- The system is quite striaghtforward to do **multiplexing**.
  - Program with multiple guide RNAs to cut out multiple segments.
- There has been a large explosion in genetics and biology for creative and interesting applications.
- Applications:

| Biology | Cell lines, model organisms |
| Biotechnology | Making changes in crop plants and fungi |
| Biomedicine | Using CRISPR as a tool to come up with novel solutions to disease. |

- The future of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome engineering:
  - Human gene therapy
  - Agriculture
  - Synthetic biology
  - Programmable RNA targeting
  - Ecological vector control (mosquito sterilization, etc.)
  - Viral gene disruption (pathogen gene disruption)
  - Screens for drug targets
