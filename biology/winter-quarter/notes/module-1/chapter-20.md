### Introduction
- Biotechnology tools often come in unexpected places.
- Precise genome editing was produced with the **CRISPR-Cas** system.

### The Biology fo the CRISPR-Cas System
- While studying salt-tolerant archaean, investigators found short repeating DNA sequences.
  - These were separated by spacer sequences with no similarity to each other or other sequences.
  - This repeat-separated-by-spacer sequence is widespread in bacteria and archaea.
- The spacer sequences are not random bits of DNA, but **DNA of different viruses that could infect the cell.**
  - These viral spacer DNAs provided immunity against further infections.
- Repeats (bacterial DNA) are between 20-50 base pairs; spacers (viral DNA fragments) are between 30-70 base pairs.
- DNA sequences that protect against these viral infections are:
  - **C**lustered
  - **R**egularly
  - **I**nterspaced
  - **S**hort
  - **P**alindromic
  - **R**epeat
- The CRISPR locus is transcribed into long pre-crRNA.
  - crRNA: CRISPR RNA.
  - Pre-CRNA processed into shorter RNA fragments.
  - Each fragment (the crRNA) contains a spacer region that is an RNA copy of part of the viral genome, flanked by bacterially encoded repeat sequences.
- crRNA binds with tracrRNA (trans-activating CRISPR RNA), and are bound with the Cas protein (CRISPR-associated protein).
  - Cas proteins are endonucleases that cut DNA compelmentary to a crRNA.
- There are four different CRISPR systems; Cas9 is the simplest and most widely used for gene editing.
- The Cas protein could be guided to a genome sequence by complementary crRNA: **possibilities for editing the genome by cutting it into specific pieces.**

### Using the CRISPR-Cas System for Genome Editing
- Next step: simplify the CRISPR-Cas system for practical use.
- Chemically synthesized DNA was transcribed in vitiro to create a fusion of crRNA and tracrRNAs, producing **single guide RNA (sgRNA)**.
- Common method:
  1. Mix sgRNA with plasmid DNA that contains the gene for Cas9.
  2. Introduce this mixture of nucleic acids into the cell.
  3. When the Cas9 gene is expressed, it associated with the sgRNA.
  4. The sgRNA guides Cas9 to a complementary target sequence in the genome.
  5. Cas9 endonuclease makes double-stranded cuts in the DNA.
- Two ways to join broken DNA:

| **Nonhomologous end joining** | A double-strand break can be repaired by joining the broken DNA back together, but there will always be insertions or deletions (indels). If DNA is cut, it will disrupt viral function. |
| **Homology-directed repair** | An intact segment of DNA that is available is fitted into the double-strand break. |

- To use HDR, scientists need to introduce a DNA fragment into the cells along with the CRISPR-Cas machinery.
  - The DNA can be a modification of the original sequence.
- CRISPR-Cas genome editing is the next revolution in biology.

### What's Been Achieved with CRISPR-Cas Genomoe Editing?

#### CRISPR-Cas Genome Editing in Agriculture
- Animal and crop scientists have embraced CRISPR-Cas genome editing because of its ease, precision, and ability to introduce multiple genome changes at once.
- With CRISPR-Cas editing, nothing foreign is inserted into the genome.
- Crop genomes can be edited by disrupting genes.
- CRISPR-Cas-edited organisms are not currentlyr egulated.

#### CRISPR-Cas Genome Editing in Ecosystems
- CRISPR-Cas can be used in a genetic engineering process called "gene drive".
- CRISPR-Cas is used to spread, or drive, a particular form of a gene to a population in just a few generations.
- Converts organisms that begin development as heterozygotes into homozygotes for an altered allele.
- Perhaps populations of mosquitos that transmit malaria could be wiped out, but what are the side effects on ecosystems?
