## Amy Wagers: CRISPR-Cas9 to Address Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

## Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disease
- A progressive and incurable muscle disease.
- Affects 1/3,500 boys.
- Caused by any number of mutations in the DMD gene that cause a lack of production of the dystrophin protein.
- Without the protein, muscle fibers lack structural stability and degenerate.

## Using CRISPR-Cas9 to restore dystrophin function
- In preclinical mouse studies, a mouse with a mutation in the middle of the dystrophin-endoding gene was used.
  - Prevents expression of the dystrophin protein, although the disease is milder than in humans.
- CRISPR-Cas9 was used to make two cuts of the mutation, removing that section of the gene.
  - The gene could be read in the way that lacked the middle part but could have *partial function*.
- Gene function could be rescued; study measured increased force by muscles.

## A preclinical proof-of-concept
- A proof-of-concept test was done.
- To bring it forward as a real treatment for humans, more work needs to be done.
- Human cells need to be tested in a culture and in a mouse to be tested in a true organismal setting.

## CRISPR provides a tool for asking many questions at once
- Because of its programmability and versatility, it can impact many areas of biology.
  - Fundamental and applied.
- The CRISPR-Cas9 system has unprecedented throughput of interrogation.
  - Can ask, "does any gene in the genome play role in this process?"
