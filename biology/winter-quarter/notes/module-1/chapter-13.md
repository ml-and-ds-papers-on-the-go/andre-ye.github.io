# Textbook Notes: Chapter 13, "Control of Gene Expression in Bacteria"
Andre Ye, 1/6/21

## Navigation

## Introduction
- Imagine seeing an orchestra; all the instruments play all at once, uncoordinated. It's not music.
- Similarly, if a bacterial cell expressed all its genes all the time, the organism would not function properly.
- Bacteria cells control the activity, or expression, of their genes.
- **Gene expression** is the process of converting information from DNA to molecules that function.

## 18.1: An Overview of Gene Regulation and Information Flow
- Bacterial organisms in your intestine compete for space and nutrients.
  - The cell must use resources efficiently.
- The cell needs to orchestrate and regulate which proteins they produce in accordance with reactions from the environment.

### Mechanisms of Regulation
- Gene expression can be controlled at any of the steps in the Central Dogma:
  - DNA to mRNA
  - mRNA to protein
  - protein to activated protein
