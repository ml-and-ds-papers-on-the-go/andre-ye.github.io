## Pluripotent Stem Cells and Gene Expression
- Every cell in our body - muscle or skin or nerve or blood cell - comes from a common group of stem cells during development.
  - Muscles with its contractile proteins, waterproof skin cells, etc. all are derived from stem cells.
- Imagine a library: it has all sorts of books, but depending on which books you read, you end up knowing a different subset of books.
- Inside the nucleus of each cell is the DNA - the "library" set of instructures.
  - Within the DNA are "books", or genes that give instructions to make different sets of proteins.
  - Different proteins change how cells look, giving them different functions.
- Every cell contains the same information, but acts differently from each other; they are "reading different books".
- A cell that is "using genes" is "expressing" these genes, or "turned on".
- How do stem cells differentiate into specialized cells? To differentiate or specialize into a cell, a stem cell "turns on" its muscle cell genes, and "turns off" other genes.
  - Proteins are made in the cell that change how it looks and how it functions.
- Stem cells are *pluripotent* - can turn into any adult cell type.
  - Cells cannot go *back* to stem cells naturally, and stick around to form our bodies.
- How does a cell decide what it's going to specialize into?
  - Cells decide this based on *cues* from an internal or external environment.

## Internal Environment Cues
- In the development of many organisms, we begin from a *zygote* that has transcription factors (and mRNA precursors).
  - Transcription factors activate certain genes and turn them on.
  - Transcription factors are clustered in one area; as the zygote divides, all the transcription factors end up in half of the cells.
  - Different genes are activated in each of these cells; this mechanism is called *asymmetric segregation of cellular determinants*.
- Transcription factors are not symmetrically distributed.

## External Environment Cues
- A cell or a group of cells can force another group to differentiate.
- Diffusion: diffuse signals that bind to receptors and cause cells to differentiate.
- Direct contact: surface proteins on two cells binding to each other.
- Gap junctions: little connections, or connexons, between cells that are connected.
- Induction is key to forming lots of our body parts, like limbs, ears, eyes, and others.

## Conclusion
The goal is to change gene expression, which causes cells to differentiate into more specialized cells.
