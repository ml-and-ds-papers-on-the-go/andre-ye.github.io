## Gene Expression Regulates Cell Differentiation
- All cells in a multicellualr organism contain the same DNA, but are composed of different types of cells.
- Certain genes are expressed or repressed to dictate cellular morphology and function.

### Do All Cells Really Contain the Same DNA?
- Substantial evidence supporting that cells within a multicellular organism have the same genome.
- Fully differentiated cell types are capable of givign rise to an entire new animal.
  - Shown in experiment: nucleus of adult frog skin cell was transplanted in a donor embryo.
  - Genome of differentiated cell used in Dolly the SHeep cloning.
- In mammals, *genes are not lost during development*, and must be regulated.

### Cell-Extrinsic Regulation of Gene Expression
- Gene expression is regulated by many extrinsic and intrinsic factors.
- Cell-extrinsic factors include environmental cues (e.g. small molecules, proteins, temperature, oxygen).
  - Can originate from *other cells*, or within the organism's environment.
- Recieving signaling molecules triggers cascades that cause semipermanent changes to transcription (expression of genes).
- Gene expression changes can change the entire organism (e.g. molting in insects).
  - Hormones can act as a signal to trigger a cascade of events and changes gene expression. This acts as a cell-extrinsic factor.
- Scientists can learn about physiological processes by studying gene expression patters changing over time.

### Cell-Intrinsic Regulation of Gene Expression
- DNA can be modified in a way that affects gene expression; chromatin can be chemically modified.
- Chromatin modification can affect gene expression by changing the accessibility of genes to transcription factors.
  - Methylation and acetylation are epigenetic becuase they don't alter the primary sequence but act at a level *just above* it.
- Changes in chromatin modification regulate gene expression during developmental cell-type specification.
- Chromatin modification can be stable over an organism's life, permanently influencing gene expression.
  - However, **chromatin modification is reversable**.
  - Chromatin modifications are erased during the production of gametes.
- Embyronic cell types are known to have a unique set of chromatin modifications; hypotheiss: chromatin modification helps lock in changes in gene expression required during development.
  - Permanent silencing of genes involved in embryogenesis drives the development of cells to more mature cell types.
- Emerging hypothesis: cell-cell signaling and epigenetic changes converge to guide cell differentiation decisions in development and later.

## Cellular Specialization
### Pluripotent Stem Cells and Gene Expression
- Every cell in our body - muscle or skin or nerve or blood cell - comes from a common group of stem cells during development.
  - Muscles with its contractile proteins, waterproof skin cells, etc. all are derived from stem cells.
- Imagine a library: it has all sorts of books, but depending on which books you read, you end up knowing a different subset of books.
- Inside the nucleus of each cell is the DNA - the "library" set of instructures.
  - Within the DNA are "books", or genes that give instructions to make different sets of proteins.
  - Different proteins change how cells look, giving them different functions.
- Every cell contains the same information, but acts differently from each other; they are "reading different books".
- A cell that is "using genes" is "expressing" these genes, or "turned on".
- How do stem cells differentiate into specialized cells? To differentiate or specialize into a cell, a stem cell "turns on" its muscle cell genes, and "turns off" other genes.
  - Proteins are made in the cell that change how it looks and how it functions.
- Stem cells are *pluripotent* - can turn into any adult cell type.
  - Cells cannot go *back* to stem cells naturally, and stick around to form our bodies.
- How does a cell decide what it's going to specialize into?
  - Cells decide this based on *cues* from an internal or external environment.

### Internal Environment Cues
- In the development of many organisms, we begin from a *zygote* that has transcription factors (and mRNA precursors).
  - Transcription factors activate certain genes and turn them on.
  - Transcription factors are clustered in one area; as the zygote divides, all the transcription factors end up in half of the cells.
  - Different genes are activated in each of these cells; this mechanism is called *asymmetric segregation of cellular determinants*.
- Transcription factors are not symmetrically distributed.

### External Environment Cues
- A cell or a group of cells can force another group to differentiate.
- Diffusion: diffuse signals that bind to receptors and cause cells to differentiate.
- Direct contact: surface proteins on two cells binding to each other.
- Gap junctions: little connections, or connexons, between cells that are connected.
- Induction is key to forming lots of our body parts, like limbs, ears, eyes, and others.

### Conclusion
The goal is to change gene expression, which causes cells to differentiate into more specialized cells.
