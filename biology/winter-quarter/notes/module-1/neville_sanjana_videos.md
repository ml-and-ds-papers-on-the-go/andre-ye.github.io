## Neville Sanjana: Genetic Screens for Improving Cancer Therapy

## Introduction
- There has been development of immunotherapy, which has been exciting for cancer research.
- There are between 50%-80% of patients that do not respond to immunotherapy, though.
- Question: what are all genes in the genome that, when their function is loss, makes you no longer responsive to immunotherapy?

## How does any one gene influence disease?
- There are 20k genes in the genome, and 5 different guide sequences per gene. 10k CRISPR guides are created.
- These guides are introduced into cells, and each has a different set of the 10k guides.
  - Therefore, each cell has a different gene knocked off.
- Genetic screening allow anyone to have a question and analyze the impact of one gene.

## Identifying genes involved in immuntherapy evasion
- A human melanona cell was taken, and a different gene was knocked out.
- Which mutations enable the cell to evade T-cell immunotherapy?
- The top 2-most enriched genes in T-cell selection were the two essential components of major histone comaptability complexes - what allows the body to surveil for infected cells.
  - When these two proteins are disrupted, the T-cells no longer recognize cancerous cells.

## CRISPR an be an efficient pointer into the genome
- Cas9 is not just something that cuts DNA, it is a general pointer into a genome.
- Thinking of it in terms of CS: a computer is useless until a specific location in memory can be pointed to and changed.
- Once an efficient pointer is achieved, the sky is the limit.
