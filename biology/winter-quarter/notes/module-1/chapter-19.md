# Textbook Notes: Chapter 19, "Control of Gene Expression in Eukaryotes"
Andre Ye, 1/7/21

## Navigation

## Introduction
- Bacteria regulate gene expression b/c of changes in their environment.
- However, for eukaryotes, different types of cells must be maintained using the same set of genes.
  - All cells differ from each other, but have the same genes.
- Eukaryote cells must react to changes in the external  *and internal* environments.
- **Differential gene expression** - cells with the same genome can express different sets of genes, because cells at different times and locations are exposed to different signals.

## 19.1: Gene Regulation in Eukaryotes - An Overview
- Eukaryotes can control gene expression at *transcription, translation,* and *post-translation*.
