## Navigation

## Introduction
- Bacteria regulate gene expression b/c of changes in their environment.
- However, for eukaryotes, different types of cells must be maintained using the same set of genes.
  - All cells differ from each other, but have the same genes.
- Eukaryote cells must react to changes in the external  *and internal* environments.
- **Differential gene expression** - cells with the same genome can express different sets of genes, because cells at different times and locations are exposed to different signals.

## 19.1: Gene Regulation in Eukaryotes - An Overview
- Eukaryotes can control gene expression at *transcription, translation,* and *post-translation*.
  - There are, however, *more levels of control*.
- **Chromatin** - the sturcture formed by DNA wrapped around proteins.
  - Eukaryotic genes have promoters, but *before* transcription can begin, DNA containing the promoter needs to be *released* from interactions w/ the protein.
  - This allows the RNA polymerase to contact the promoter.
  - This is **chromatin remodeling**.
- **RNA processing** is required to produce a mature mRNA in eukaryotes (splicing introns, etc.)
  - Alternative splicing can include exons, which result in different gene products.
- **mRNA stability** can be regulated, such that certain mRNAs can have a shorter or longer life span.

### Summary of Levels of Gene Expression in Eukaryotes
1. Chromatin remodeling - "opening" chromatin for the RNA polymerase
2. Transcription - produce the pre-mRNA
3. RNA processing - process the pre-mRNA to form mature mRNA
4. mRNA stability - make changes to the mRNA that can degrade mRNA life span, if necessary.
5. Translation - create a polypeptide corresponding to the mRNA sequence.
6. Post-translational modification - activate or deactivate proteins.

## 19.2: Chromatin Remodeling
- For a signal to trigger transcription of a gene, chromatid around the target gene must be remodelled.
- DNA is very tightly wrapped since there is so much information; this does not allow RNA polymerase to access it.
- It must be "unwrapped" such that it *can* be accessed and transcribed.

### Chromatin Structure
- Eukaryotic DNA is associated with **histone** proteins (generally speaking; other proteins may be used as well).
- Chromatin looks like beads on a string; these beads are **nucleosomes**.
  - Each nucleosome is about 200 base pairs of DNA wrapped almost twice around 8 histones.
  - Histone protein called **H1** "seals" DNA to each set of histone proteins.
  - DNA is negatively charged (phosphate groups); histones are positively charged (lysines and arginines).
- Nucleosomes are linked to each other to form chromatin.
  - H1s interact with each other and other histones to produce a tightly packed structure.
- These fibers are attached at intervals along their length to framework proteins; this allows the chromosome to be organized.
- Each chromosome lies in its own territory of the interphase nucleus.
  - Parts fold into actively transcribed sites; location matters.
- Chromatin has important implications for gene expression control.

### Chromatin Structure is Altered in Active Genes
- The interaction between DNA and histones **must be altered** for RNA polymerase to interact with it.
  - A gene cannot be transcribed *until* the condensed chromatin near the promoter is remodeled.
  - **Chromatin remodelling is the first step of eukaryotic gene expression.**
- **DNase** is an enzyme that cuts DNA at random locations. However it cannot cut DNA if it is wrapped with proteins; so it can only work with DNA if the DNA is "decondensed" or in *open configuration*.
  - Wintraub and Groudine experiment: compared chromatin structure of beta-globin and ovalbumin.
  - Beta-blogin is hemoglobin found in red blood cells, ovalbumin is a protein found in egg white. Beta-globin should be transcribed at high levels in blood cells, and the opposite for ovalbumin.
  - Findings: DNase cut beta-globin gene DNA much more than ovalbumin gene DNA. Hence, chromatin of beta-globin was *decondensed* and chromatin the ovalbumin gene was *condensed*.
- **Chromatin is decondensed in genes that are being transcribed**.
- By default, eukaryotic genes are "turned off" b/c they are normally wrapped tightly in chromatin.

### How is Chromatin Altered?
- There are three ways to remodel chromatin: DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin-remodeling complexes.

#### DNA Methylation
- **DNA methyltransferases** add methyl groups to cytosine residues in DNA via **DNA methylation**.
- The sequence recognized by enzymes is a C next to a G (`ATAT[CG]TA`). The methylated sequences are abbreviated `CpG`.
- Methylated `CpG` sequences are recognized by proteins that **trigger chromatin condensation**.
  - Hence, actively transcribed genes **have fewer methylated CpG sequences near their promoters**.

#### Histone Modification
- Many enzymes add several chemical groups to histone protein amino acids.
  - Includes acetyl groups, methyl gruops, phosphate groups, and short polypeptides.
- Modifying histones alters the bond between DNA and histone proteins.
  - **This can condense or decondense chromatin**, depending on the modifications.
- Proposal: histone modification combinations set the state of chromatin condensation for a particular gene. **Histone code hypothesis**.
  - **histone acetyltransferases (HATs)** add acetyl groups to positively charged lysine residues of histones. This interferes with assembly nucleosomes in condensed chromatin.
    - Process known as **acetylation** - promotion of *decondensed* chromatin and active transcription. The "on switch".
  - **histone deacetylases (HDACs)** remove acetyl groups. This reverts chromatin into a condensed state. The "off switch".
  
#### Chromatin-Remodeling Complexes
- **Chromatin-remodeling complexs** are proteins that form macromolecular machines.
  - Harness energy in ATP to *reshape* chromatin.
  - Can cause nucleosomes to slide along DNA or knock histones off DNA to open chromatin for transcription.
- **Condensation state of chromatin is critical in determining whether transcription can occur or not.**

### DNA and Chromatin Modifications Vary and Can Be Inherited
- Chromatin modifications vary from one cell type to another (e.g. skin and liver cell).
- When skin or liver cells divide, **DNA methylation and histone modification patterns are passed to duaghter cells.**
  - Daughter cells inherit patterns of gene expression via **epigenetic inheritance**. (inheritance of anything other than DNA sequences)
- Chromatin is modified early in its development to form a certain cell, like a skin cell.
- Epigentic mechanisms can record life events and are difficult to erase. Prenatal conditions can make long-lasting alterations in the chromatin of embryos that influence phenotypes.

#### Long-Lasting Epigenetic Marks Imposed During Development
- Experiment: what happens to rats born to mothers fed low-protein diets during pregnancy and nursing?
  - Animals have a greater risk of developing disorders similar to type 2 diabetes, even though a normal diet was provided after early deprivations.
- *Hnf4a* is a gene associated with diabetes; codes for a regulator of genes involved in glucose uptake.
  - Epigentic inheritence could be silencing *Hnf4a* expression.
- Results of analysis: **histone modifications of *Hnf4a* gene led to condensed chromatin** for rats born to malnourished mothers.
- A mother's nutritional status is repsonsible for chromatin modifications seen in offspring.

#### Epigenetic Inheritance is Widespread
- Environmental influences early in life can be recorded into patterns of chromatin condensation.
- Human mental retardation - Rett syndrome. Occurs when mutation l eads to absence of a protein that binds to methylated DNA to induce chromatin condensation.
