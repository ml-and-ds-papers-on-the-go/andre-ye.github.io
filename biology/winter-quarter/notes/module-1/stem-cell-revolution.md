### Chapter 3: Not All Cells Are Equal
- It is incredibly important we have all stem cell systems working; one cannot substitute for another.
- The blood-forming system make blood only; same for brain systems, skeletan muscles, etc.
- THe specialization of funciton is a feature of stem cells; the *embryonic stem cell* comes from the early embryo (~ 100 cells).
- Inside the early embryos are pluripotent stem cells; they can differentiate to make every sort of cell in the body.
	- They can become a new source of cells.
- It was an unusual type of cancer that gave a rise to embryo stem cells; teratocarcinoma.
- When things go wrong, we can see how the body works; to make the connections requires a conceptual leap.
- Most tumors are a nasty cariacture of a particular tissue; tumors have different tissues inside them, like teeth, etc.; a cariacture of a developing embryo.
	- There are in some cells that have the ability to differentiate.
- If there are tumor cells, you can grow them in the culture; growing cells that have the ability to develop into every other cell.
- It was a huge achievement; stem cells must have been kept undifferentiated to produce new stem cells.
	- The cells *wanted* to develop and differentiate; yet somehow they needed to be held back.
- These tumor cells were almost *identical* to embyronic cells, but simply in the wrong environment.
- Are cells from tumors normal? - yes.
- Teratocarcinoma cells modelled early embyronic development.
- Embyronic stem cells were taken directly from embryos; they could differentiate.
- The mouse produced was using embyronic stem cells.
- in vitro fertilization treatment.
- The usage of embryos is quite controversial.
- Pluripotent states - can make all sorts of cell types.

### Chapter 4: The Discovery of iPS Cells
- A tool of *reversing* cells, and perhaps we can avoid using human embyros to get stem cells.
- Yamanaka - had difficult patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, and there is no treatment.
	- Began interested in basic research, perhaps able to treat and help those patients.
- We know that each cell in our value contains something that determines its cell identity; the genes in the nucleus are expressed differently. Genes that are turned off are locked away in the chromatin.
- Yamanaka questioned if a cell must remain locked in a differentiated state.
- Begins with a list of over 100 transcription factors - operated alone, or in combination.
	- Distinguished 24 most likely candidates for transcription factors.
	- Found 4 (Oct 4, Sox2, Klf 4, and cMye) essential transcription factors.
- The four transcription factors began to turn on embyronic stem cell genes; we can thus turn somatic cells back into embyronic cells.
	- Only four factors are needed to "reset".
- We don't need embryos, but we can make ES-like stem cells; induced Pluripotent Cells (iPS).
- It was surprising that only four transcription factors are needed; it is a massive change in the nucleus.
- Work is based partially on precedented experiments.

### Chapter 5: Where could it lead?
- Because stem cells have changed the way we understand it, they have raised new questions about ethics, religion, and government.
- As soon as iPS cells have succeeded, new issues have been generated.
- Because iPS cells are pluripotent, they can be used to make sperm and eggs; thus, a human can be created from a piece of skin. It's possible in theory; keep an eye on this research.
- Be careful what you wish for; should stem cell research stop? - It's too late.
- Making iPS cells is simple for anyone with some biological training; but there needs to be more discussion with government, the public, and other entities.
- Science is morally neutral; they are tools, but any tool that is not being used sits there.
	- The people that put things to use make the moral choice.
- Progress in stem cell research has become very rapid.
