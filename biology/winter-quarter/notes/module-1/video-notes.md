## Operons and Gene Regulation in Bacteria

- DNA regulation: if you look at an organism's genome, not all the genes are being translated & transcripted at the same time.
  - e.g. immune and muscle cells have the exact same DNA,
- Even unicellular organisms do not want to transcribe all their genes at the same time; different types of genes serve different purposes that may or may not need to be expressed.
- RNA polymerase attaches to the *promoter*; polymerase transcribes the gene.
  - Each promoter is associated with a gene in eukaryotes.
  - In prokaryotes, multiple genes may be grouped together that only have one promoter, or *regulatory DNA sequence*.
  - RNA polymerase attaches to this and transcribes multiple genes as a bundle.
  - Promoter + gene forms an **operon**.
- The operon is transcribed into one strand of mRNA, which is translated into several proteins.
- A repressor attaches to a series of DNA after the promoter, blocking polymerase from doing transcription.
  - The operator is a sequence where the repressor can attach.
- The repressor may only be able to do its job if other molecules - **corepressors** - are attached to it.
- An **activator** allows *more* transcription. Small molecules that turn the *activator* on are **inducers**.

## Lac Operon
[Access here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/regulation-of-gene-expression-and-cell-specialization/v/lac-operon){:target="_blank"}
- *Lac* operon deals with lactose; e.g. `lacZ` codes for an enzyme that cleaves it into simpler sugars.
- If there's no lactose, there is no need to translate enzymes needed. Lac repressor prevents the RNA polymerase from transcribing.
- If there *is* lactose, *allolactose* (version of lactose) acts as an inducer of transcription. It binds to the lac repressor, which can no longer bind to the operator site.
  - Allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the genes.
- Glucose is preferred by the cell, though.
- CAP site; the Catabolite Activator Protein, in the presence of cAMP, binds to the cap site and allows further transcription.
  - If you have high glucose, cAMP is inhibited.
- If there is both glucose and lactose,
  - There will be allolactose, so the RNA polymerase will be able to transcribe.
  - However, there is low cAMP, which cannot bind to the CAP, which will not bind to the CAP site and act as an activator.

## Jacob Monod lac operon

- An eye cell and a skin cell have the exact same DNA, but different genes are expressed.
- Usually, protein regulation happens at the transcription level; it's the most efficient.
- Lac operon found in *E. coli*.
- `Lac Z`, `Lac Y`, and `Lac A` genes help break down lactose into glucose and galactose.
- Default: these genes are not expressed.
- The RNA polymerase attaches to the promoter; on the operator site, a repressor sits and blocks the RNA polymerase.
- When there is lactose in the cell, the lactose attaches to the repressor protein and makes it come off the operator site.
  - RNA polymerase moves and transcribes all the genes.
