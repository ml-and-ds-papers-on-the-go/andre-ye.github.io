### Stem Cells
- Characteristics of stem cells: self renewal (can divide for very long times) and differentiation (into different lineages)
- Two types of stem cells:
  - Adult stem cells (can be found in almost every organ)
  - Embryonic stem cells (blastocyst containing pluripotent stem cell)

#### Stem Cell Potency
- Can be divided iby their potency, what they can give rise to.
  - Totipotent embryonic stem cell, can give rise to ~80 cells
  - Pluripotent embyronic stem cells
  - multipotent stem cells, much more restricted in specialization
- Yamanaka generate iPS pluripotent cells from somatic cells.
- Main focus of the Ellison stem cell core - pluripoptent embyronic stem cells.

#### From Zygote to Newborn
- Cells begin dividing to form the blastocyst; inner cell mass divides into all sorts of other cells in the body.
- More than 50% of all fertilized eggs fail to develop.
  - A big issue for couples trying to conceive.
  - In Vitro fertilization success rate is 12% - very low, still.
- Understanding early steps and the rise of a human being is very interesting to study.

#### Human Embryo Development
- Uterus implants; before it implants, it is a "blastocyst".
  - Inner cell mass is where embryonic stem cells are developed.
- Done in 1998 - Human ESC (hESC) established.
- Inner cell mass from blastocysts have properties:
  - self renewal
  - virtually unlimited cell division
  - pluripotent
  - express a specific set of markers

### Why study/use pluripotent stem cells?
- Basic biology - to understand early steps fo development
- Improvement of In Vitro fertilization
- Disease modelling
- Drug therapy

#### Regenerative Medicine
- Replacing or "regenerating" human cells, tissues, or organs to restore normal function.
- Potential use of stem cells for lots od fiferent diseases.
- Focus of Mathieu's research is on basic biology and improvement of in-vitro fertilization.

### Embyronic Development
- Naive hESC and primed hESC; even if they are very close to each other in terms of time and development, they are very different.
- In terms of epigenetic regulation, metabolism, DNA repair; there is a lto of difference between naive and primed ESCs.
- CRISPR screen to uncover genes/pathways to go from naive to primed.

#### Embyronic Diapause in Mice
- Embyronic diapause is arrested development or delayed implementation; a reproductive strategy used by over 100 mammalian species.
- If there is not enough food or will not be able to take care of new animals, they have the ability to arrest development before implantation; it develops into the blastocyst but then stops.
- Determine genes and pathways activated, as well as metabolic state.

### Ellison Stem Cell Core
- Located in South Lake Union - Mathieu, Cavanaugh, Hesson.
- Goals:
  1. Facilitate human pluripotent stem cell research
    - Work with many institutions in Seattle.
    - Sources of pluripotent stem cells
    - Shared laboratory sapce
    - Pre-tested reagents
    - Training in culture and iPSC generation
    - Gene editing in pluripotent stem cells (Main focus)
    - Addition of services as needed
  2. Research relevant to quality of pluripotency

#### Research
1. Cryopreservation - how to best freeze cells?
2. Stages of pluripotency
3. Human embyros for research - patient consent, maintain quality stocks for generative medicine and improving IVF
4. Understanding DNA repair mechanisms in stem cells to improve genome editing techniques
5. Generation of new iPSC models - dogs, whales, rhinos, etc.

### Genome Editing
- Exploded very recently.
- New tools that make it efficient to modify the DNA of cells.
- Applications:
  - Basic research: knock out genes to study their function, generate reporter lines to follow some proteins
  - Disease modelling: try to correct genes causing disease

#### CRISPR Technology
- Based on natural immunity of bacteria to protect themselves from infections by viruses.
  - Immune system of the bacteria.
  - Doudna and Charpentier repurposed this system for genome editing.
    - Nobel Prize 2020
    - First time two women get the Nobel Prize; very early after their discovery.
- CRISPR can be used everywhere from plants, cell lines in culutre, clinical trials, animals, and human embryos.

#### CRISPR gRNA/enzyme complex
- `gRNA` - guide RNA, have a PAM sequence (`NGG`). 
- `Cas9` - loop in `gRNA` allows `Cas9` to bind; `gRNA` will bring `Cas9` to a specific place in the genome and cuts exactly where it is brought.
- Induces a double-stranded break.
- Two methods of DNA repair:
  - Non-Homologous End Joining. Introduces InDels.
  - Homology Directory Repair. Based on long-sequence flanking homology.

### Example of a Project: Study of a Mutation Causing Cardiac Disease
Patient with mutation believed to cause cardiomyopathy.
1. Generation of iPSC from the patient. Reprogram into iPSCs; extract DNA and perform PCR to see where mutations are.
  - Sanger sequencing: differences mean that one allele has a mutation.
  - iPSCs can be differentiated into cardiac cells.
2. Correction of mutation using CRISPR Cas9
  - gRNA recognizes this region.
  - Donor DNA contains correction to be introduced.
Corrected mutations; cells can be used not only to look at phenotype but to test new drugs in patient iPS cells.

### Regulatory and Ethical Questions
#### Use of Embyronic Stem Cells
Generation and use of embyronic stem cells regulated at various levels.

| Federal | Illegal to use federal funding to generate embyronic stem cells; Core built and equipped using private donor money. |
| State | Federal government defers to states to decide what hESC work is legal. |
| University | Each university has their own regulation on what they can or cannot do with embyronic stem cells. UW GIM36, Oversight (ESCROW, IRB) |

#### UW GIM36
- No UW personnel shall engage in and no UW facilities, equipment, or other resources shall be utilized for any of the following:
  - Human reproductive cloning
  - In vitro culture of an intact human embryo for more than 12 days of development or until formation of the primitive streak, whichever occurs first
  - Payment of a donor solely for the purpose of creating a human embryo to be used in hESC research
  - Implanting a chimeric embryo containing non-human cells into the uterus of a human
  - Implanting a chimeric embryo containing hESCs into the uterus of any vertebrate animal
  - Using federal funds to engage in ineligible hESC research
  - Engaging in hESC research in a manner contrary to federal, state, or local laws and regulations.
- A new GIM36 will include iPSC; old policy about embyronic stem cells completed about 10 years ago.

#### Gene Editing of Human Embryos
- "CRISPR babies" - human embryos can be edited in the United States.
  - Dr. He introduced two babies with CRISPR-Cas9 edited gene.
- The ethics of editing human genomes.
- He introduced a mutation in a gene that would help babies be less susceptible to HIV infection.
  - It is not known if this would work.
  - CRISPR field, even though is moving very fast, is not there yet.
  - Cas9 can cut in other places of the genome by accident.
  - Mosaicism; not all the cells will have the same edits.
- Should we introduce mutations into the embryos of humans?
  - Something important to discuss; not only safety but ethical concerns.
  - Which diseases should it be applied to? - which ones should not be prevented?
- No law regulates this yet; people are working on how to control this.
