### Peer Review as Conversation
- What is peer review?
- How can we think of peer review as a conversational process?
  - Exchanging ideas and feedback - the whole dynamic of asking questions.
  - You are not *bound* to your reviewer, but it is an oppurtunity to think about the choices you make in your writing, and to be able to approach those conciously.
  - Audience is a very important component.
  - Conversation with literature - your peer reviewer will have some familiarity, but there is a dynamic of conversation with the literature.
    - *Who are you in conversation with?*
- Peer review is a dialogue between writers and reviewers.
  - Discussion of the ideas being presented and how they are presented.
