# Textbook Notes - 13.1 and 13.2: Meiosis

## Introduction
- People have known that during sexual reproduction, a male reproductive cell (**sperm**) and a female reproductive cell (**egg**) unite in **fertilization**.
- The formation of **gametes**explain why each gamete has half the usual number of chromosomes.
** Meiosis** is a nuclear division that leads to a halving of the chromosome number.
  - Ultimately leads to the production of a sperm and egg.
  
## 13.1: How Does Meiosis Occur?
- To understand meiosis, we must first understand ideas about chromosomes.
- Consider this observation:
  - Each organism has a *characteristic number* of chromosomes.
  - e.g. your cells have 46 chromoomes, dogs have 78, some ferns have 1000.

### Chromosomes Come in Distinct Sizes and Shapes
- American cell biologist Nettie Maria Steven, 1906.
- Found that although a specific fly species had 8 chromosomes, there were *five distinct types*.
  - In males, two chromosomes (known now a `X` and `Y`) were *unpaired*.
  - In females, there was a pair of `X` chromosomes (and no `Y` chromosome).
- `X` and `Y` chromosomes are **sex chromosomes**; any other chromosomes are **autosomes**.
- Chromosomes that are the same size and shape are **homologous chromosomes** (also referred to as **homologs**).
  - A pair is a **homologous pair**.
  - Contain the same gene in *the same positions* along the genes.
  - However, are *not* identical.
- A **gene** is a segment of DNA found at a place in the chromosome that influences a trait.
  - e.g. chromosome 2 in *Drosophila* contains a gene that influences eye color.
  - An **allele** is a *version* of a gene.

### The Concept of a Ploidy
- Stevens identified the fruit fly **karyotype** by identifying the number and types of chromosomes present.
- Many organisms (including humans) have *two version* (homologs) of each chromosome; these are **diploid**.
  - One allele is carried on each of the homologs.
- Bacteria, archaea, etc. have cells that contain only *one type* of chromosome, called **haploid** ('single-form').
  - Have only one copy of each chromosome; an individual has only one allele of each gene.
- **Notation used by biologists:**
  - *n* represents number of *distinct type* of chromosomes in a cell, called the **haploid number**.
    - In humans, *n*=23.
  - For sets of chromosomes, use *2n*, *3n*, etc.
- The number of chromosome *ets* is the cell's **ploidy**.
  - Diploid cells are *2n* because there are two chromosomes.
    - **Maternal chromosome** from the mother and **paternal chromosome** from the father.
    - Note that in human, *2n* = 46.
- **Many species have >2 types of a chromosome.**
  - These are **polyploid** ('many form').
    - Polyploid species can be triploid (*3n*), tetraploid (*4n*), hexaploid (*6n*), octoploid (*8n*), etc.

### An Overview of Meiosis
- Cells replicate each of their chromosomes before starting meiosis.
- An unreplicated eukaryotic chromoome begins as a single, long DNA double helix wrapped around histones (proteins).
  - DNA is replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle.
  - Replicated chromosome consists of two **sister chromatids**.
  - Each sister chromatid contains an identical copy of the DNA double helix.
- An unreplicated chromosome is never called a chromatid; it is only used to describe an individual chromosome after replication.

#### Meiosis Consists of Two Cell Divisions
- Back-to-back cell divisions occur in meiosis, **meiosis I** and **meiosis II**.
- Homologs of each chromosome pair are separated in meiosis 1.
  - Homologs go to respective daughter cells.
- At the end of meiosis I, each daughter cell has **one** of each chromosome instead of two.
  - (half as many chromosomes are the parent cell).
  - Diploid parent cell produces two haplooid daughter cells.
  - Note: each chromosome still has two siter chromatids.
- During meiosis II, sister chromatids of each chromosome separate.
  - Sister chromatid becomes an individual chromosome (called daughter chromosome).
  - Each daughter cells has one copy of the daughter chromosome.
  - Sister chromatids separate into daughter chromosomes during meiosis II.
    - Note: this is what happens during mitosis.
- Chromosome movement during meiosis I and II:
  - ...depends on microtubules of the **spindle apparatus**.
  - these attach to the **kinetochores**.
  - are located at the **centromere** of each chromosome.

#### Meiosis I is a Reduction Division
- Reduction of chromosome number in meiosis I makes the division different from meiosis II or mitosis.
- Original cell entering meiosis is diploid; four daughter cells are haploid.
- Some or all haploid daughters go on to become egg cells or sperm cells.
  - Process of **gametogenisis** ("gemete-origin")
- When two haploid gametes fuse during fertilization, the chromosomes form as diploid cells again.
  - Resulting diploid cell from *fertilization* is a **zygote**.
  
### Phases of Meiosis I
- Meiosis is a set of continuous events.

#### Early Prophase I
- Nuclear envelop breaks down, spindle apparatus forms.
- Siter chromaetids are held by proteins called **cohesins**.
- **Homologous chromosome pairs come together**.
  - Result is the **synapsis**.
  - Pairing of homologous chromosomes along their regions.
