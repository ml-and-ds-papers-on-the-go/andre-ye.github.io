## Meiosis: Where the Sex Starts, Crash Course Biology
*Available [here](https://kcts9.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/c65df616-fffc-461b-8d70-c13bc4bc4c1a/meiosis-where-the-sex-starts-crash-course-biology-13/){:target="_blank"}*
- Sexual reproduction; cells split repeatedly to form a human.
- Most of your somatic (body) cells replicate through cell identification.
- Mitosis replicates a cell with 46 chromosomes into two identical cells.
  - However, you cannot clone yourself.
  - Mitosis is not the only cell division method we have.
- All of your body cells have the same DNA; 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs.
  - Contain versions of the same alleles; one in each pair from your mom and one from your dad.
  - Similar; pairs are 'homologous chromosome pairs'.
- Special cells that have only 1/2 of the amount: sperm and egg cells.
  - Haploid cell (half the full set of chromosomes).
  - Need each other to combine to complete the full 46 chromosomes.
- Mitosis needs meiosis.
  - Diploid cell splits in half twice, producing four cells.
- Raw material for meiosis: in ovaries or the testies.
  - Primary Oocytes or Primary Spermatocytes.
- **Interphase:** long strings of DNA begin to replicate.
  - **Centrosomes:** being to replicate as well, are a set of cylinder-like proteins that regulate how materials are moved around along ropey proteins called microtubeles.
- **Prophase 1**: centrosomes begin heading to their corners of the cell, unspooling the microtubeles.
  - Each DNA clumps with proteins into chromosomes; each chromosome is linked with its duplicate copy to form X-shaped double chromosome.
  - Each of the chromosomes when attached are chromatids.
    - Each double chromosome has two chromatids.
  - **Crossover**: Each double chromosome lines up with its homolog.
    - Double chromosomes have 4 chromatids between them.
    - One chromatid in each X gets tangled up with the other; forming crossover.
  - **Homologous Recombination**
    - During crossover, exchange DNA (recombination).
- If we simply cloned to ourselves, we would not have variation for natural election.
  - All 4 chromatids are now different; each chromatid will end up in a separate sex cells.
- One pair of chromoomes does not always go through crossover or recombination: 23rd chromosome, **sex chromosomes**.
  - Female: two complete cells.
  - Male: only one X chromosome, and the other doesn't do with the Y (not homologous)
  - Half of resulting sperm are X and half will be Y.
- **Metaphase 1**: each chromosome lines to its homologous pair partner.
- **Anaphase 1**: These get pulled apart to separate ends of the cell.
- **Telophase 1**: A nuclear membrane forms around each; cleavage forms between the cells and the two cells form. *Cytokenisis*.
  - Two haploid cells have been formed.
  - Centromeres till look like X.
  - Aim is to end up with four cells.
- Aim: not to duplicate double chromosomes, but to pull them apart into separate single-strand chromosomes.
- **Prophase II**: just bunch into separate ends.
- **Metaphase II**: chromosomes are moved into alignment into the middle of the cell.
- **Anaphase II**: the two trands are pulled apart, the crease forms, and four total cells are produced.
- Result: four cell with 23 chromosomes each.
  - Half will be male, half will be girls.
- During telophase I, more of the cytoplasm, organelles, etc. head into one of the cells; same with telophase II.
  - Forms 1 *egg* (with more nutrients and organelles to make the new embryo) and 3 polar bodies (esentially useless).

## Khan Academy Fertalization Terms
*Access [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/heredity/meiosis-and-genetic-diversity/v/fertilization-haploid-diploid-gamete-zygote-homologous){:target="_blank"}*
- When the sperm and the egg cell fuse, this is *fertilization*.
  - Produces a cell that differentiates into all the cells of our body.
- Each of the sex cells (sperm cell and the ovum) are called **gametes**.
  - Each gamete has half the number of chromosomes as the somatic cells of your body.
- Fertilization setup.
  - 23 chromosomes from your father.
    - 23rd chromosome is X or Y; if it is X, it is female; if it is Y, it i male.
  - Fuses with the ovum (egg that the mother is contributing), which has 23 additional chromosomes.
    - 23rd chromosome is X.
- When the two gametes are fused:
  - The 'fertilized egg' iss the **zygote**.
  - 23 chromosomes from the father and 23 chromosomes from the mother form 23 chromosome pairs.
    - Pairs are *homologous chromosomes*.
    - Means that these two chromosomes code for the same proteins, but there are variants for how they code for those variants.
- Haploid and diploid number/cells.
  - Human haploid number is 23 ('hapl' - single), number of chromosomes in each of the gametes.
    - Referred to as *n*.
  - Human diploid number is 46 ('di' - two), number of cells in zygote.
    - Referred to as 2*n*.

## Chromosomal Crossover in Meiosis I
*Access [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/heredity/meiosis-and-genetic-diversity/v/chromosomal-crossover-in-meiosis-i){:target="_blank"}*.
- Germ cell; a cell that can go through mitosis to produce germ cells or undergo meiosis to produce other germ cells, or to undergo meiosis to produce gametes.
- Hypothetical: Diploid Number is 4.
- **Interphase**: grows and replicates DNA; after replicating, it is still one *chromosome*.  
  - Made up of two sister *chromatids*.
- At this point, either mitosis or  meiosis can happen.
  - This will focus on meiosis.
- **Prophase I**
  - Nuclear membrane begins to dissolve.
  - DNA begin to bunch up into 'condensed form' into 'X's.
  - Centromere is at the middle of the Xs.
  - DNA has been replicated; in each of the chromosomes exist two siter chromatids.
  - In a homologous pair, there are *four chromatids*. Often called a tetrad.
  - *Genetic/homologous* recombination; may contain different DNA but code for the same genes.
- Recombination; DNA is swapped at certain sections.
  - Happens fairly often, and is a way to get variation.
  - Exchange of information between these chromosomes.
  - Generally happens at fairly 'clean' points, called the chiasma.
    - plural: chiasmata.
