# Chapter 3 Notes: "From Writing Summaries and Paraphrases to Writing Yourself Into Academic Conversations"

## Summaries, Paraphrases, and Quotations

There is a distinction between paraphrasing and summarizing.
- `Paraphrasing` is rewriting a chunk of text in different language. *Usually the length doesn't change that much.*
- `Summarizing` is significantly reducing the length of a text by identifying and conveying key ideas.

Both paraphrasing and summarizing are good pathways for inquiry.
They force you to think critically about the text instead of passively accepting it.

When you read,
- *paraphrase* when information is important but the specific language is not important to the discussion.
- *summarize* when only the important ideas of a text are needed.
- *quote* when an excerpt of text is so memorable, important, and authentic that the only way express its true value is to present it in its original language.

## Writing a Paraphrase
A `paraphrase` is a restatement of information in your unique language.
- Keep in mind key words. What are other ways to state them?
- Swap around word order and sentence structure.

Example: James Gunn's essay "Harry Potter as Schooldays Novel" [^1]
```
The situation and portrayal of Harry as an ordinary child with an extraordinary talent make him interesting. He elicits our sympathy at every turn. He plays a Cinderella-like role as the abused child of mean-spirited foster parents who favor other, less-worthy children, and also fits another fantasy role, that of changeling. Millions of children have nursed the notion that they cannot be the offspring of such unremarkable parents; in the Harry Potter books, the metaphor is often literal truth.
```

A possible paraphrase (written by me):
> Gunn observes that audiences have embraced the character of a normal but prodigous child, mistreated by guardians who fails to recognize his talent, played by Harry Potter. This figure, Gunn points out, is very similar to the one in Cinderella. This embodiment has made millions of young Harry Potter readers adamant in their potential for success, despite perhaps unimportant parents.

Why paraphrase at all?
- Academics that write for their peers use technical jargon; paraphrasing can act as a translator.
- Paraphrasing helps you understand the text better; **it cuts to the ideas and not just the language**.

Neither summaries nor paraphrases are better or worse; they are suitable for different situations.

To write a paraphrase,
1. Determine whether a paraphrase is necessary at all.
2. Familiarize yourself with the text.
3. Draft the paraphrase by expressing the same ideas in your unique language style.
4. Attach the source to protect yourself from plagiarism.

## Writing a Summary
`Summaries` condense a large quantity of information.
By reading like a writer, one can summarize better.
To write a good summary requires the main points to be accurately identified.

There are four important aspcts of writing good summaries:
1. Understand the writer's main ideas.
2. Identify supporting evidence the writer uses to justify the main ideas.
3. Communicate the essence of the author's argument given this information.
4. Put the summary in proper context to elevate it beyond a shortened paraphrase.

### Example: The Process of Writing a Summary
A (personally written) process of constructing a summary of Clive Thompson's *On the New Literacy*. [^2]
| Task | Content |
| :-------: | :---------------- |
| Understand the writer's main ideas. | - Many complain about how in the technological era, kids do not know how to write; language has been dehydrated and abused through the narcism of social media and the obscene compression of language in texting. <br/> - This is unwarranted. We are actually *in the midst of a literacy revolution.* <br/> - Young people write far more than any generation before, because technology gives them more places to express themselves through language. <br/> - Writing is not 'good' or 'bad'; today's young people know *who* they are writing for, which is the most important.|
| Identify supporting evidence. | - Andrea Lunsford of Stanford University performed research and comes to these conclusions. <br/> - Lunsford found that technology gave students many more chances to write <br/> - Lunsford found that assessing what was necessary to appeal towards a particular audience needed to be convinced came naturally to students.|
| Communicate the essence of the author's argument. | > Technology is not an inhibitor of literacy and language but instead a catalyst; today's young people are given more oppurtunities to express themselves and have developed a skill of great writing - assessing the audience - that goes beyond what we may consider to be, at a surface level, 'literacy'.
| Put in context. | See footnote [^2] for information on the author and which fields & journals he writes in. |

**Work in progress.**
