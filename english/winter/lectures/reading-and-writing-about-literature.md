### Reading Critically
- Look beyond what the text says on a surface level to discover what it means.
  - "look behind the story"
  - Find the meaning; metaphor, symbol, reading between the lines
- A story is being told on the plot-sentence-level; yet literature is also a form of art.
  - Literary artists choose plots, words, characterizations, etc. in order to signal towards something further and deeper than what is simply on the page.
  - Identify and decipher "clues" the author leaves behind.
- Basic ways to look for these clues; look at the context in which the words are presented.
  - Language and tone (diction, dialect, word choice, author's stance towards what is happening)
  - Figures of speech
  - Humor
  - Rhythm (pacing, meter, rhyme)
  - Figurative language
- **Focusing on the *method* and the *scale* rather than simply story.**

### Reading Creatively
- Attempting to fully occupy the world that the text imagines to better understand abstract ideas nad broader themes.
  - We need to inhabit the world the writer creates to truly experience what's going on.
  - We are suspending our sense of reality and engaging with the reality (or 'unreality') set up by the author of the text.
- Literary critics move one step beyond imagination (i.e. 'here I am in this story'), looking at *how* the author manipulates the reality (i.e. setting, characterization, tone, the five senses, etc.).
  - **How** is it so that readers suspend their place to engage in the world the writer paints?
  - Techniques, artistic choices, devices, etc.

### Uniquely American Literature
- This class will focus mostly on American literature.
  - Can apply to literature from other national contexts.
- Analyzing the world the author sets up but also as a literature that came out of *our world*.
  - Hence, it comes from a specific context; social and other factors influencing authors.

### Writing About Literature
#### Scholarship
- Think about it in terms of professional literary criticism: think of yourself as a beginner literary critic, in which [reading, thinking, writing] are the actions of this world.
- There are conventions and etiquette that shape this scholarly world.
- Literary criticism is a conversation about how texts become markers of ideological and societal forces that shape a person's perspective.
- When we talk about literature, we engage with it often first from our own position.
  - These judgement calls come from where we find ourselves in this culturally diverse landscape.
  - Immediate reactions may be offended/positive/negative/confused.
  - This is simply reading, not *scholarship*.
- After immediate reactions, recognize that we will read and think as individuals, but that we will read and think with the goal of entering a conversation that has ground rules, etiquette, precedent, and conventions.
  - Not enonugh to say "I don't like this story"; this is your response - valid as a reader, but not as someone entering a conversation.
  - Find a scholarly dispute; perhaps the artistic choices that lead you to a certain argumentative stance.
- Normal, natural, and expected to have gut reactions. However, they are not what scholarship is about; this course may introduce texts that may elicit negative immediate reactions.
  - Thinking outside of our own immediate reactions.
  - Sometimes, these reactions may be more about us than they are about the text.
  - Enter a text with an **openness** and **humility**.
    - Are you focusing more on your own reaction than the text?
- **Entertain different perspectives and opinions**, be open-minded when reading texts.

#### Consider What You Know and Think
- What do you know after you read literature?
- Scholarship pushes past summary to consider what we think.
- Our initial thoughts and opinions are starting points to develop into a scholarly action.
  - Does the author make choices to elicit those reactions? (e.g. dislike of a character)
  - Hence entering the realm of literary criticsm.

### Observe, Question, Interpret, Reflect
- The Hermeneutical Circle: in every act of learning, we understand, explain, appropriate, and repeat.
  - Pushes one back into a *reconfiguration* after reflection and appropriation.
  - The understanding changes because of reconfiguration of ideas.
- Rereading something, responding to something: just a first step of literary criticism or learning anything.
  - Push past initial facts and continue to question, interpret, and to reflect.

### Question Your Opinions and Responses
1. **Summarize**. Clarify what you know.
  - Ensure that the basics of reading comprehension have taken place.
  - Plot, character.
2. **Evaluate**. FInd and articulate the reasons for your initial response.
  - What in the text leads you to respond in a certain way?
    - Characters' actions? Speech? Tone?
  - Influences outside of the text conditioning your response?
  - Can this text be brought in comparison with others?
  - Comparisons between texts; incorporating broader themes and ideas.
3. **Analyze**. 
  - How do parts and questions relate to a whole?
  - What are components of the text and how do they contribute to the work as a whole?
  - Themes, structure, roles, contexts.
4. **Synthesize**.
  - If analyzing breaks the work into parts, synthesizing helps build connections betweent he parts.
    - Making an argument about how a text is situating itself in the literary, generic, real worlds.
  - Create an umbrella argument - a larger argument under which several observations and perspectives can stand.
