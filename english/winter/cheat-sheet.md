## Guidelines of Literary Analysis
### The Five Standards of Litery Analysis
1. **Makes interpretative claims.** The claim should revolve around the stasis of interpretation.
2. **Are debatable.** If a thesis is not debatable - not prone to disagreement - it is not a literary analysis.
3. **Supported with evidence from the text.** Risk-taking arguments are valued, but must be backed by evidence.
4. **Evidence argues for a thesis about the text.** Interpretative claims must be connected via a thesis about the text.
5. **Explores the complexity of the test.** Literary analysis assumes the literature is complex; highlight how the discussion offers complex messages.

### The Five Stases

| **Argument type** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- |
| Existence or Fact | Seeks to establish what facts are depicted in a text |
| Interpretation | Characterizes a text |
| Evaluation | Makes a judgement about the text being enjoyable, tasteful, good, bed, etc. |
| Causal | Investigating impacts of factors on the production of the text |
| Proposal | Argues an action be taken in relation to the text |

## Strategies for Close Reading
- Surface/Depth strategy
- Patterns strategy

### Surface Depth Strategy
Central strategy of literary analysis: **surface/depth**; finding deeper meanings behind the surface interpretation of a text. A critic points out multiple layers of meaning; from the surface to deeper in. Link these layers - surface and the depth - to make an argument about the *full* meaning of the text.
- **Surface/depth linking strategy.** Link a surface reading to a concept, idea, or thought not stated explicitly in the text. This is a *deeper interpretation*, it is not immediately obvious.
- **Surface/depth contrasting strategy.** Contrasts a simplistic reading of the text to a more complex reading.

Common words used to link surface to depth:
> appears, connotes, figures, illustrates, indicates, is, masks, means, represents, reveals, seems, shows, signifies, stands for, suggests, symbolizes, underlies

Common words used to contrast surface-level and deeper readings:
> *Characterizing a surface reading*: appears, at first, may, seems

> *Introducing a deeper reading*: although, but, even though, however, now, while

### Patterns Strategy
The **patterns** strategy involves highlighting motifs, or reoccuring elements in the text. Use the patterns strategy before or after you have developed a surface/depth argument to explore ideas or to bolster them, respectively. To use the patterns strategy effectively, a critic
- provides multiple pieces of evidence—quotations, paraphrases, or summaries—to illustrate a pattern
- connects the evidence illustrating the pattern to a surface/depth argument
- shuttles back and forth between evidence and argument
- usually begins with the most obvious example and moves to the least obvious

Phrases used to introduce a patterns argument:
> throughout, often, repeatedly, frequently, recurrently, many examples, many times, several instances

Phrases used to connect multiple examples in a patterns argument:
> again, moreover, furthermore, additionally, also, another example, similarly, further, even, finally
