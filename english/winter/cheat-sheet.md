### All Strategies

Note: remember to link later. add "going deeper" to surface-to-depth section.
| Strategy | Category | Brainstorming | Writing Persuasively |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Surface to Depth | Close Reading, Ch.3 | Get a sense of the text's literal meaning, then consider several layers of meaning to help you better imagine counterarguments to the analysis you settle on. Consider many possibly conflicting ideas about deeper meanings to a text. | The *surface-depth linking strategy* links a surface reading to a concept or idea not stated explicitly in the text. The *surface-depth contrasting strategy* contrasts a simplistic reading of the text with a more complex reading. |
| Patterns | Close Reading, Ch.4 | Patterns can be used before and after developing a surface/depth claim. Note reptitions and recurrences throughout the text, or use the patterns strategy to discover evidence to support your argument. | A persuasive use of patterns must connect multiple patterns of a pattern with a clear surface/depth interpretation. |
| Opposites | Close Reading, Ch.6 | Look for concepts, ideas, patterns, characters, or settings that appear to be in tension. | Arguments using the opposites strategy note oppositions, provide textual evidence, and explains how the text subverts traditional understandings of these opposites. |
| Context | Beyond the Text, Ch.7 | The context strategy involves making connections to knowledge from many swathes; wonder about the significance of items, terms, and other aspects of the literature, then research about them.

### Guidelines of Literary Analysis
#### The Five Standards of Litery Analysis
1. **Makes interpretative claims.** The claim should revolve around the stasis of interpretation.
2. **Are debatable.** If a thesis is not debatable - not prone to disagreement - it is not a literary analysis.
3. **Supported with evidence from the text.** Risk-taking arguments are valued, but must be backed by evidence.
4. **Evidence argues for a thesis about the text.** Interpretative claims must be connected via a thesis about the text.
5. **Explores the complexity of the test.** Literary analysis assumes the literature is complex; highlight how the discussion offers complex messages.

#### The Five Stases

| **Argument type** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- |
| Existence or Fact | Seeks to establish what facts are depicted in a text |
| Interpretation | Characterizes a text |
| Evaluation | Makes a judgement about the text being enjoyable, tasteful, good, bed, etc. |
| Causal | Investigating impacts of factors on the production of the text |
| Proposal | Argues an action be taken in relation to the text |

### Strategies for Close Reading
- Surface/Depth strategy
- Patterns strategy

#### Surface Depth Strategy
Central strategy of literary analysis: **surface/depth**; finding deeper meanings behind the surface interpretation of a text. A critic points out multiple layers of meaning; from the surface to deeper in. Link these layers - surface and the depth - to make an argument about the *full* meaning of the text.
- **Surface/depth linking strategy.** Link a surface reading to a concept, idea, or thought not stated explicitly in the text. This is a *deeper interpretation*, it is not immediately obvious.
- **Surface/depth contrasting strategy.** Contrasts a simplistic reading of the text to a more complex reading.

Common words used to link surface to depth:
> appears, connotes, figures, illustrates, indicates, is, masks, means, represents, reveals, seems, shows, signifies, stands for, suggests, symbolizes, underlies

Common words used to contrast surface-level and deeper readings:
> *Characterizing a surface reading*: appears, at first, may, seems

> *Introducing a deeper reading*: although, but, even though, however, now, while

#### Patterns Strategy
The **patterns** strategy involves highlighting motifs, or reoccuring elements in the text. Use the patterns strategy before or after you have developed a surface/depth argument to explore ideas or to bolster them, respectively. To use the patterns strategy effectively, a critic
- provides multiple pieces of evidence—quotations, paraphrases, or summaries—to illustrate a pattern
- connects the evidence illustrating the pattern to a surface/depth argument
- shuttles back and forth between evidence and argument
- usually begins with the most obvious example and moves to the least obvious

Phrases used to introduce a patterns argument:
> throughout, often, repeatedly, frequently, recurrently, many examples, many times, several instances

Phrases used to connect multiple examples in a patterns argument:
> again, moreover, furthermore, additionally, also, another example, similarly, further, even, finally

#### Opposites Strategy
- One productive strategy for discovering complex interpretations is to look for opposites in a text.
- Interpretations that break down opposites are valued in literary studies because they influence how we see the world.
- Searching for arguments about opposites in a text is usually productive; this search usually leads to other insights to help you find a complex argument about a text.
- When critics use the opposites strategy, their arguments usually have several steps.
  1. Note oppositions as a tension in the text (usually through surface/depth).
  2. Provide textual evidence that elaborates on these tensions.
  3. Explain how the text subverts a normal way of looking at these opposites.
- Common opposites or tensions:

| life/death | natural/unnatural | male/female |
| strong/weak | self/other | inside/outside |
| youth/age | love/hate | truth/deception |

- Common Words and Phrases Associated with Context

| although | contrasting | rooted in the same ___ |
| appears | ironically | two facets of the same ___ |
| opposed | at first it seems | paradoxically |

### Strategies for Going Beyond the Text
#### Genre and Form
- Some genres:

| Broad | poetry, fiction, drama, nonfiction, comedy, tragedy, history |
| Poetic | elegy, sonnet, ballad, ode, dramatic, monologue |
| Popular | romance, mystery, horror, western, courtroom, drama |

- Arguments about genre are persuasive when:
  1. They support a clear surface/depth interpretation;
  2. Do not contain extraneous information;
  3. Follow proper citation practices;
  4. Make an argument about the genre.
- Questions to ask yourself about a genre:

| **Cultural associations** | Who usually reads and writes this genre? Is it associated with an ethnic or social group? |
| **Subject matter** | What kinds of subject and content matter does one expect to find int he genre? What conflicts does the genre include? Are there common themes or motifs? |
| **Purpose** | Does the genre have a purpose, like to celebrate or mourn? Does it convey a moral? |
| **Style and tone** | Is the genre dark or light? Does it use elevated diction or plain speech? |
| **Characters or speakers** | Are there "stock" characters typically found in the genre? Are there common personality traits? |
| **Settings** | What settings does the genre usually take place in? |
| **Rhythm, meter, and rhyme** | Is the genre associated with a particular rhyme scheme or meter? Is there an order or pattern the genre is supposed to follow? |

- Petrarchan and Shakespearean sonnet comparisons:

| | **Petrarchan** | **Shakespearean** |
| Named after | Franceso Petrarca | William Shakespeare |
| Formation | Eight-line octave with ABBA ABBA rhyme scheme and six-line sestet with flexible rhyme - usually CDECDE or CDCDCD. | Three groups of four lines (quatrains) and a pair of lines (couplet). Rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. |
| Structure | Two parts of the sonnet form an argument; octave describes the problem and sestet proposes a resolution. Ninth line creates a turn. | The third quatrain or the couplet contain an unexpected sharp term; summarizing the theme of the poem and introducing a new look at it. |
| Subject matter | Unattainable love | Love and its torments, time, the immortality of poetry compared to the fleeting beauty of youth. |

- Common words and phrases associated with genre:

| breaks from | contradicts | overturns |
| plays with | subverts | surprises |
| unexpected |
