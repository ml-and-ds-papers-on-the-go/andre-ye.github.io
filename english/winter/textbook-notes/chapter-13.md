### Understanding the Role of the Thesis Statement
- A thesis is a succint statement that summarizes your most important overall argument.
  - It usually makes a surface/depth argument that indicates the complexity of the text.
- Thesis statements make debatable arguments that define something complex about the texts.
- Thesis statements usually appear near the beginning of an essay, where they summarize and preview ideas that will be developed.
- Placing the thesis statement early allows literary critics to make complex arguments that are easier to follow.
- Argument should pique the reader's curiosity; think of the thesis statement as starting a conversation for the readers.
  - As a writer and critic, anticipate responses and answer them in your essay.
- Writing a good thesis is not the product of some one epiphany; often it emerges slowly through exploration and analysis.

### Analyzing the Well-Organized Essay
- Traditional structure for literary analysis:
  - Thesis appears at end of 1st para.
  - Paragraphs of the body develop and support part of the thesis.
  - Final paragraph exttends the argument and answers *'What does this poem mean or illustrate?'*
- Complex arguments often require more complex structures than the five-paragraph essay.
- **Reverse outline** - outline written after the essay is written.
  - Read through the essay and write down the main argument of each paragraph.
- Essays are ordered by *logical progression* rather than sequence of the poem.

### Topic Sentences Aid Recall
- Research on how readers process texts shows that topic sentences help readers recall what they're read.
- Topic sentences being paragraphs; this lets readers more quickly remember what they ahve read.
- Writers will want to ensure their most important arguments appear in topic sentences.

### Developing a Thesis by Freewriting or Reverse Outlining
- **Freewrite** - essay draft or pre-draft to help write down all thoughts about a text.
  - No editing or censorship: get as much down the page as possible.
- Afterwards, create a reverse outline to see what major arguments are.

<br>

### Developing a Thesis with an Outline-First Strategy
- Some other critics like to plan carefuly first by preparing outlines for major arguments and topic sentences.
- Make lists of patterns; help generate a thesis, then add new lists and revise into a more coherent thesis.
- Crate outlines with milestones or signposts before trying to draft pose.

<br>

### Moving Between Drafting, Organizing, and Discovering
- All strategies move back and forth between reading the text and drafting and organizing arguments.
  - Try out multiple arguments before decidin gon a thesis.
- Some ideas may be dead ends; move between what you have written and try out new ideas.
- Be open to new ideas that emerge when you write.

### Characteristics of a Well-Organized essay
1. Each paragraph in the body of the essay is clearly connected to the thesis.
2. Each paragraph in the body focuses on a single argument or two closely related arguments.
3. Each paragraph builds on the previous paragraphs. In other words, the paragraphs are connected to one another but avoid repeating the same arguments.
4. The essay is ordered by logical progression of the arguments rather than by strictly following the chronological order of the literary text that is the focus of the essay.
