## Introduction
- The **patterns** strategy involves highlighting motifs, or reoccuring elements in the text.

## Using Patterns to Brainstorm
- Patterns can be used both before and after developing a surface/depth claim.
  - Beforehand: come up with plausible & complex surface/depth arguments.
  - Afterward: improve arguments.

### Using the patterns strategy before a surface/depth argument
- Note repetitions and recurrences throughout a text; work to make sense of possible deeper layers.
  - i.e. an image, a word, or a sound; locate instances surprising to others on a second or third reading.
  - The device does not need to reappear the same way every time for it to be recurrent.
- Mark repititions in the margins of text, then brainstorm ideas about what they may mean.
- There are no hard rules about what types of reptitions you may find; just be curious about any reptition you see and a deeper meaning it may reveal.

### Using the patterns strategy after a surface/depth argument
- If you have already developed a surface/depth argument, you can use the patterns strategy to discover evidence to support this argument.
- Think of the surface/depth claim as rough; be open to revising claims about what a further reading of the text revelas.
  - Use the patterns strategy to take notes in the text that may support the interpretation.
  
## Using Patterns to Write Persuasively
- Patterns and surface/depth go hand-in-hand; a persuasive use of patterns must connect multiple examples of a pattern w/ a clear surface/depth interpretation.
- To use the patterns strategy effectively, a critic
  - provides multiple pieces of evidence—quotations, paraphrases, or summaries—to illustrate a pattern
  - connects the evidence illustrating the pattern to a surface/depth argument
  - shuttles back and forth between evidence and argument
  - usually begins with the most obvious example and moves to the least obvious

- Phrases used to introduce a patterns argument:
  > throughout, often, repeatedly, frequently, recurrently, many examples, many times, several instances

- Phrases used to connect multiple examples in a patterns argument:
  > again, moreover, furthermore, additionally, also, another example, similarly, further, even, finally
