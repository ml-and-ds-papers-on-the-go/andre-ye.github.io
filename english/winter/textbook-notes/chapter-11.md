## Notes on Chapter 11: "Joining the Critical Conversation"

### Introduction
- There are good reasons to draw on published literary criticism.
- Treat these publications as further turns into conversations about texts.

<br>

<br>

### Repeating the Conversation vs. Contributing Something New to the Conversation
- Repeating what a published critic says to bolster your own argument is a legitimate but *limited* function.
- If you only repeat what others have said, nothng new is brought to the discussion.

### Moving Beyond "Because the Experts Say So"
- Many experts disagree with each other in temrs of interpretation; thus this is clear one should not take any one interpretation as definitive.
  - The nature of disagreement can be starting point for conversation.
- Writers recognize they are not the first critics to write on a literary work.
  - The interpretations of other critics are summarized such that the writer of the analysis "speaks back" to these critics.
- A **summary** distills others' arguments, or describes the situation to which the critic is responding.
- A **paraphrase** can run longer than the original passage, and it sometimes makes use of language directly from the original passage.

### Entering the Discourse Community of Published Criticism
- It is important to connect to what others have said, and to say something different.
- Good conversationalists know how to signal tey have listened, while steering conversation towards their interpretation.
- Three strategies to connect previous discussions to signalling a new contribution:

| Strategy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Add new evidnece** | Support a claim with evidence others have not mentioned or noticed. |
| **Add new interpretations** | Interpret the same passages others have interpreted in new ways. |
| **Disagree with previous interpretations** | Disagreement as a critic can serve as a starting poitn for your own argument as you explain what is wrong with one viewpoint, and defend another. |

### Using the Critical Conversation to Brainstorm
- Reading arguments by other critics can be a good way to generate ideas about issues, aptterns, or problems worth noticing ina  text.
- Wait until you have developed a series of questions about a text before you read published criticism about it.
- Example questions[^1]:

| I have noted some moments in the text that seem significant but I’m not sure how to interpret them. Have other critics made arguments about these same moments? Have they created plausible interpretations? Am I satisfied with their interpretations? |
| I have noticed a pattern in the text. Have other critics noticed this pattern? Have they made persuasive surface/depth interpretations about this pattern? |
| I have done some initial research on some contextual references in the text and have some ideas about how to interpret them. Have other critics noticed these contextual details? Have they made similar interpretations? Are there any contextual details that critics seem to be misinterpreting? |
| I am interested in the socially relevant issues that this text seems to raise. What have other critics said about race or gender or other socially relevant issues in this text? |
| I am thinking about using a particular theoretical lens to interpret the text. What other theoretical lenses have critics used? Have they used the lens I am thinking of, or might my use of it yield interpretations others have not already made? |

- Having particular questions in mind allows you to maintain your own perspective as you converse with published critics.
- Sometimes, this means abandoning a particular topic b/c otherds have already persuasively solved it.
- Read as much published criticism as you can; read carefully for what critics say *and do not say*.
