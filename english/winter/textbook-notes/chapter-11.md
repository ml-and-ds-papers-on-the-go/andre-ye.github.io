### Introduction
- There are good reasons to draw on published literary criticism.
- Treat these publications as further turns into conversations about texts.

<br>

---

<br>

### Repeating the Conversation vs. Contributing Something New to the Conversation
- Repeating what a published critic says to bolster your own argument is a legitimate but *limited* function.
- If you only repeat what others have said, nothng new is brought to the discussion.

<br>

<br>

### Moving Beyond "Because the Experts Say So"
- Many experts disagree with each other in temrs of interpretation; thus this is clear one should not take any one interpretation as definitive.
  - The nature of disagreement can be starting point for conversation.
- Writers recognize they are not the first critics to write on a literary work.
  - The interpretations of other critics are summarized such that the writer of the analysis "speaks back" to these critics.
- A **summary** distills others' arguments, or describes the situation to which the critic is responding.
- A **paraphrase** can run longer than the original passage, and it sometimes makes use of language directly from the original passage.

### Entering the Discourse Community of Published Criticism
- It is important to connect to what others have said, and to say something different.
- Good conversationalists know how to signal tey have listened, while steering conversation towards their interpretation.
- Three strategies to connect previous discussions to signalling a new contribution:

| Strategy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Add new evidnece** | Support a claim with evidence others have not mentioned or noticed. |
| **Add new interpretations** | Interpret the same passages others have interpreted in new ways. |
| **Disagree with previous interpretations** | Disagreement as a critic can serve as a starting poitn for your own argument as you explain what is wrong with one viewpoint, and defend another. |

<br>

### Using the Critical Conversation to Brainstorm
- Reading arguments by other critics can be a good way to generate ideas about issues, aptterns, or problems worth noticing ina  text.
- Wait until you have developed a series of questions about a text before you read published criticism about it.
- Example questions[^1]:

| I have noted some moments in the text that seem significant but I’m not sure how to interpret them. Have other critics made arguments about these same moments? Have they created plausible interpretations? Am I satisfied with their interpretations? |
| I have noticed a pattern in the text. Have other critics noticed this pattern? Have they made persuasive surface/depth interpretations about this pattern? |
| I have done some initial research on some contextual references in the text and have some ideas about how to interpret them. Have other critics noticed these contextual details? Have they made similar interpretations? Are there any contextual details that critics seem to be misinterpreting? |
| I am interested in the socially relevant issues that this text seems to raise. What have other critics said about race or gender or other socially relevant issues in this text? |
| I am thinking about using a particular theoretical lens to interpret the text. What other theoretical lenses have critics used? Have they used the lens I am thinking of, or might my use of it yield interpretations others have not already made? |

- Having particular questions in mind allows you to maintain your own perspective as you converse with published critics.
- Sometimes, this means abandoning a particular topic b/c otherds have already persuasively solved it.
- Read as much published criticism as you can; read carefully for what critics say *and do not say*.

### Finding Published Criticism
- Most professional criticism is published in journals that can only be accessed with a paid subscription.
- This means you need to access journals through the library, and not just web searches.
- Good databases for literary criticism:
  - Literature Online (LION)
  - JSTOR
  - Project Muse
  - MLA International Bibliography

### What If There is Little or No Conversation About a Text?
- A recently published or overlooked text has little published criticism.
- Regardless, there are other ways to join the discourse community.

| Join a conversation about other literary texts by the same author. |
| Look at criticism on the genre and extend those critics' insights to the text. |
| Look at criticism on texts written in the same time and geographic region. |
| Book reviews may have literary criticism to offer. |

### Using the Critical Conversation to Write Persuasively
- Your introduction is a good place to explain how you are adding something new to the critical conversation.
- Or, respond to critics throughout your essay.

#### Remind readers what has been said in the conversation you are joining
- Conversations in the form of literary analyses unfold much more slowly.
- A first step is to briefly summarize what has been said before.
- Make sure you understand the critics you are citing, and use proper conventions for quotations and documentation.

#### Distinguish your views from those of the critics you cite
- Make sure readers can easily distinguish between what is original in an essay and what is a paraphrase.
  - For instance, "Critic A argues X, but **I argue** Y" makes clear Y is your argument.
- Other ways to distinguish your views from previously published views when adding something new:

| Adding new evidence | Support a published critic's cliam interpreting one part of a text with new evidence drawn from other parts of the text. |
| Adding new interpretations | Signal to your readers that previous interpretations are valid, but you have discovered another layer of meaning. |
| Disagreeing with a critic | Using disagremeent as an entryway through which to join critical conversation relies on a surface/depth-contrast strategy. |

#### Support your views
- Focus on other strategies of literary analysis in the rest of your paper and make the case for your thesis.
- You may want to respond to a specific claim, in which follow the previous steps again.
- Phrases associated with joining a critical conversation[^1]:

| Association | Phrase |
| --- | --- |
| **Adding New Evidence** | Critics have had a lot to say about X, but what they have not noted is Y. |
| Adding New Evidence | Critics have discussed X, but no one has mentioned Y. |
| Adding New Evidence | Critics have debated X. However, if we note Y, many of these issues are resolved. |
| Adding New Evidence | Critics have discussed X but have generally shown little interest in Y. |
| Adding New Evidence | Critic A has said X about text Y. A similar argument can be made about text Z. |
| **Adding New Interpretations** | Critic A has said X about text Y. A similar argument can be made about text Z. |
| Adding New Interpretations | Critics have interpreted X in several ways, but they have not seen this meaning in X. |
| **Disagreeing w/ Previous Interpretations** | Critics have said X. In this essay, conversely, I will argue Y. |
| Disagreeing w/ Previous Interpretations | Critic A has said X. On the surface, this interpretation seems plausible. However, if we look at Y, Critic A’s interpretation cannot hold. |
| Disagreeing w/ Previous Interpretations | Critics have interpreted X as Y. While I agree with X, I disagree that it means Y. Instead, I argue Z. |
