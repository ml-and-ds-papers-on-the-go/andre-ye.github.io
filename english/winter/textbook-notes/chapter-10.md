### Introduction
- This chapter introduces a strategy that uses materials from outside to help assist interpretation.
- **Theoretical lens strategy** - critic makes explicit use of another argument or theory to explain a possible layer of meaning.
- **Theory** - an argument that attempts to explain something.
- A theoretical text can act as a lens for reading a primary text.
- Analyses that use the theoretical lens strategy place their explanatory assumptions on the table for readers to inspect and debate.
- Parts of the strategy:
  1. A theoretical text acts as a lens for discovering arguments in the primary text.
  2. The primary text reflects on the theoretical text by challenging or extending some aspect of the theory.

### Theoretical Lens vs. Context
- Both theoretical lens and context strategy make use of material from outside text to deepen an interpretation.
- Difference deals with the type of text cited and the extent to hwich the text is used as a framework for analysis and interpretation.
- Theoretical lens strategy uses complex explanatory arguments as an interpretative tool.
- Context strategy uses factual information to inform an interpretation.

### Using the Theoretical Lens Strategy to Brainstorm
1. **Choose a theoretical lens.** You may read a theoretical text and recall a primary text that illustrates the theory.
2. **Work to understand the surface meaning of both primary and theoretical texts.** To use the theoretical lens strategy effectively, understand the surface meaning of both texts.
3. **Re-read the primary text using the surface/depth strategy.** Look for deeper meanings that could be explained by arguments in the theoretical text.
4. **Reflect on how the primary text differs from the theoretical text.** Does the primary text differ from or extend the theoretical text?

### Using a Theoretical Lens to Write Persuasively
- It is possible to use the theoretical lens strategy on the small scale by "name-dropping" a theorist or theoretical argument as support for a specific interpretation.
- More commonly, thereotical lens are used as an overarching frame for the entire essay.
- To make an extended argument, 
  - name and cite the theoretical text; accurately summarize the text's argument;
  - use the surface/depth strategy to show how deeper meanings in the primary text can be explained by concepts from the theoretical text;
  - support your surface/depth claims linking the primary and theoretical texts with textual evidence from the primary text;
  - reveal something complex and unexpected about the primary text;
  - challenge, extend, or reevaluate the theoretical text for more sophisticated analyses.
- A theoretical argument must be summarized in the theoretical lens strategy, so it can result in a delayed thesis.
