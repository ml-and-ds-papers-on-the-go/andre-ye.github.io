### Introduction
- One of the criteria for a successful literary analysis is that it must be supported yb textual evidence.
  - Two types of evidence: primary and secondary sources.

<br>

<br>

### The Quotation Sandwich
- Think of quotations and textual evidence as a metaphorical sandwich.

| Bun | Present argument | State the main argument the quotation will support. |
| Lettuce & Tomato | Introduce quotations | Explain where the text occurs; use transitions. |
| Meat | Quotation | Include only as much text is needed. |
| Bun | Interpret quotation | Explain why the qutoation is significant. |

- A majority of the paragraph should be the writer's own argument.
- Repeat key words from the argument to build coherence and emphasize main ideas.

<br>

<br>

### Good Repetition vs. Bad Repetition
- When writers repeat the same ideas without adding new information, the lack of novelty is *bad reptition*.
- Good reptition occurs when writers add new ideas but repeat key words or phrases to help readers follow their thought.
- As arguments become more complex, *good reptition* becomes important to make your arguments coherent.
- Good reptition can also involve synonyms.

<br>

### Quoting vs. Paraphrasing
- A paraphrase involves restating the text and its events in your own words.
- Use direct quotation when the exact wording is important to your argument, and use paraphrase when the exact wording is not central to your interpretation.
- Some long quotations can include extraneous information; paraphrase and trim quotes.
  - Point the reader in a specific direction of attention.

<br>

<br>

### Mechanics of Quoting
- Use present tense to describe what happens in a literary text.
- If a quotation is longer than 4 lines of text, use long quotation format.
- Use a slash to indicate line breaks for poetry, and use long form if the quotation si longer than three lines
- When quoting dialogue between 2+ characters in a play, indent by one inch.
- Use single quotation marks for the internal quote and double quotation marks for the quote you are using.

### Documenting Quotations and Paraphrases
- Give readers information to let them find the passage you quoted.
- An **in-text citation** refers to the page number the quote came from, as well as the author if it is not clear.
- A **works cited list** provides information for every text cited, alphabetically. 
```
Last name, First name. Title of book. City of publication: Publisher’s name, Year of publication. Format.
Frye, Northrop. Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1957. Print.
```
- If the text has been republished, include information about original publication and republication:
```
Wordsworth, William. “The World Is Too Much with Us.” 1802. Digging into Literature: Strategies for Reading, Analysis, and Writing. Joanna Wolfe and Laura Wilder. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2016. 156. Print.
```
