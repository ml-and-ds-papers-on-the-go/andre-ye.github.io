## Introduction
- Discussing strategies to argue about texts that literary critics use when writing analyses.
  - These help critics make claiims that define what a text means and are debatable, supported w/ evidence, and complex.
- These strategies can reveal multiple layers of meaning.
  - Mental places to go to for discovering an argument: **topoi**.

## What is the Surface/Depth Strategy?
- Central strategy of literary analysis: **surface/depth**; finding deeper meanings behind the surface interpretation of a text.
  - A critic points out multiple layers of meaning; from the surface to deeper in.
  - Link these layers - surface and the depth - to make an argument about the *full* meaning of the text.

## Using Surface/Depth to Brainstorm
- **Surface reading** - what readers notice readily in a work.
- Getting a sense of the text's literal meaning may be challenging, like changes to language over time.
- Consider many possibly conflicting ideas about possible deeper meanings to a text.
  - Some initial ideas may be implausible or dead ends.
- Considering several layers of meaning can help you better imagine counterarguments to the analysis you settle on.
  - It can also allow for a more complex interpretation, accounting for several layers of meaning.

## Using Surface/Depth to Write Persuasively
- Literary scholars use surface/depth to discover and develop possible interpretations; this process *can be messy*.
  - The surface/depth strategy moves from a reading strategy into a literary analysis of the poem.
- Use two variations for presenting surface/depth claims in a literary analysis.

### Using the surface/depth linking strategy
- Link a surface reading to a concept, idea, or thought not stated explicitly in the text.
  - This is a **deeper interpretation**, it is not immediately obvious.
```
In "Morning Song", *motherhood* [surface] is *represented* [link] through *images of emptiness* [depth] that *indicate* [link] a *loss of the mother's self.* [depth]
```
- Common verbs used to link surface to depth:

| appears | connotes | figures | illustrates |
| indicates | is | masks | means |
| represents | reveals | seems | shows |
| signifies | stands for | suggests | symbolizes |
| underlies | | | |

### Using the surface/depth contrasting strategy
- Contrasts a simplistic reading of the text to a more complex reading.
```
Initially, "Morning Song" seems to be a loving tribute to motherhood [surface reading]. However [contrast word], a closer reading suggests that the speaker is significantly troubled by the baby [deeper reading].
```
- Contrasting can start turning conversation by showing disagreement over the interpretation of a text.
  - Implies you can make a complex argument about the text that requires explanation and support.
  - This is the goal of literary analysis.
- The contrasting argument will delay the thesis until the second or even third paragraph of the essay.
- Common words used to contrast surface-level and deeper readings:
  - *Characterizing a surface reading*: appears, at first, may, seems
  - *Introducing a deeper reading*: although, but, even though, however, now, while

## Plausible vs. Implausible Readings
- Surface/depth can be used in more and less persuasive ways; how to use this strategy persuasively is challenging.
  - The more surprising and nonobvious the interpretation, the more potential it has for literary analysis.
  - However, critics must provide plausible reasons.
- Good evidence can be found in quotations and paraphrases.
- Surface/depth arguments **must be faithful to the surface meaning of a text**.
  - You can clarify howo your deeper meaning connects to and enhances the surface meaning.
- **Symbol-hunting** is an attempt to force a text to fit in an interpretation.
  - It can be more reductive than complex because it shuts down the meanings truly contained in a text.

## A Note on Persuasive Interpretations
> "Well, that's my interpretation." "It's a poem, so I can read into it whatever I want."

- Such is not the goal of literary analysis; the speaker rejects the communal nature of literary analysis.
- An interpretation that is closed to others has no obligation to the text or to be credible and persuasive.
- Surface/depth offers credible and persuasive reasons that allow readers to better understand the text.
