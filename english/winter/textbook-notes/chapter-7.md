### Introduction
- A close reading interprets text through careful, close attention to details.
- The next chapters iwll focus on strategies to take attention beyond the text at hand while still contirbuting to the ultimate goal of interpretation.
- Context may involve looking up references to events, people,a nd other works to create surface/depth arguments.
  - Or, researching social/cultural context a text was written in.
- Using the context strategy may require bringing in external help.

### Common Types of Contextual Information
- Common types of contextual information include information about
  - historical period or culture a text was written in;
  - cultural references within a text;
  - the historical meaning of particular words used in a text;
  - other texts mentioned or alluded to in the work
  - other writings byt he same author or his/her contemporaries
- Critics can also bring biological information about an author to support an argument.
  - however, use biographical information sparingly to avoid making causal arguments, which can distract from the goal of interpreting a text's meaning.

### Using Context to Brainstorm
- The context strategy involves making connections to knowledge from many swathes.
  - It often appears in the form of notes to look something up, or to research something later.
- Wonder about the significance of items, terms, and other aspects of the literature; then find out more about them.

### Finding Contextual Information
- Researching to find potentially useful contextual information requires some imagination and curiosity.
  - Follow up on hunches and leads, and abandom those that don't end up working out.
- Finding contextual information using general web searches
  - Search engines can turn up a plethora of information, and getting useful results will take time.
  - Remember to cite your source afterwards.
- Finding contextual information using library databases
  - Campus libraries and library websites cna serve as portals for excellent contextual information inaccessible from ordinary web searches.
  - By searching for scholarly peer-reviewed articles on, for example, *JSTOR*, one can find accurate and detailed sources.
- Finding contextual information using the *Oxford English Dictionary*
  - *OED* provides not only definitions but an evolving history of the meaning of words over time.
  - Many college libraries provide access to *OED* online.

### Using Context to Write Persuasively
- Context is used most effectively when it
   - Supports a surface/depth argument;
   - Contains only as much information as is needed to support the argument;
   - Correctly cites information that is not common knoweldge;
   - Illustrates the complexity of the text.
- Common words used with context:

| anachronistic | contemporary | context |
| contextualize | cultural | genealogy |
| historical | historicize | intertextual |
| political | situate | social |

### Options for the Scope of the Context Strategy
- Context can not only be used to elaborate on a specific symbol or reference, but to bolster larger arguments.
- Can help support patterns strategy by showing another way the text reveals a pattern or recurrent meaning.
- Using context strategy in a large-scale scoep can lead to a choice to delay stating the thesis.

### Context and Authorial Intension: Productive Tensions
- What role should an author's intensions play in a critic's analysis of a work?
- Recent critics argue one needs to understand history to join the uathor's intended audience.
- Contextual details often ensure a critic does not completely ignore an author's intensions.
