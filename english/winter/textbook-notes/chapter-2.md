### Introduction
- **Literary analysis** - analytic essays.
  1. Makes interpretative claims
  2. Are debatable
  3. Supported with evidence from the text
  4. Evidence argues for a thesis about the text
  5. Explores the complexity of the test
- Meeting these five objectives makes an argument valued by literary critics.

### A Literary Analysis Makes Interpretive Claims
- Greek and Roman rhetoricians categorized arguments into five points of disagreements.
- **Stasis** - point where the controversy rests.

| **Argument type** | **Explanation** |
| --- | --- |
| Existence or Fact | Seeks to establish what facts are depicted in a text |
| Interpretation | Characterizes a text |
| Evaluation | Makes a judgement about the text being enjoyable, tasteful, good, bed, etc. |
| Causal | Investigating impacts of factors on the production of the text |
| Proposal | Argues an action be taken in relation to the text |

- Most literary analyses' stasis is around interpretation.
- A literary analysis consists of many interpretative arguments.
- Primary purpose is to explain what a text is, and what readers should take away from it.
- Literary analyses **differ from plot/character summaries or book/film reviews** because they focus more on facts or are evaluation judgements (respectively).

### A Literary Analysis must make Debatable Claims
- Main interpretative claims must be *debatable*; people must be able to *disagree* with your claims.
- If everyone agrees with each other in the discussion 'parlor', it doesn't make for a very interesting one.

### A Literary Analysis Supports Arguments with Textual Evidence
- Arguments that take risks are valued, but must be backed by evidence.
- What is counted as 'evidence' depends; look towards context.
  - For literary scholars, most important sources of evidence are from the text itself.
  - Careful interpretation & analysis of direct quotation are valued.
- Furthermore, explain evidence that may seem to contradict you argument instead of leaving it out.

### A Literary Analysis Argues for a Thesis About the Text
- A literary analysis makes a series of interpretative claims; yet the critic must *connect claims into a **thesis** about the text*.
- A thesis requires looking a the meaning of individual elements of a text to make a bigger picture.
  - What messages does the text communicate?
  - What is the author trying to say?
  - What does the text reveal about cultural and societal influences in which the author was working?

### A Literary Analysis Explores the Complexity of the Text
- Literary analysis assumes that literature is complex, and that texts prevent a web to be untangled.
- Highlight how the text under discussion offers complex messages.

<br>

<br>

### Complexity of arguments vs. complexity of expression
- Don't use complicated words or other inflation devices to make a simple argument seem artificially complex.
- It is the argument, not the expression, that should be complex.
- A well-written argument allows for readers to follow a complex concept with little difficulty.
