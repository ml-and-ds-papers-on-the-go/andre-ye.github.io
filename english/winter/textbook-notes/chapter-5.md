### Introduction
- One of the main strategies of a literary analysis is finding a deeper meaning.
- The overall goal of a literary analysis is to show complexity in a work.
- This chapter will overview aspects of texts that literary critics pay attention to when generating patterns and surface/depth arguments.

### Character Descriptions
- Character analysis should not be the goal of the essay, but information about the people in literary texts is a good starting place for analysis.
- Good questions to ask:

| How are the characters physically described? |
| What language is used to describe the character's actions? |
| How do the characters talk? What does this reveal about the character? |
| What actions are performed by the character, especially ones with potentially contradictory motives? |
| Do the names given to the characters have significance? |
| Is there a clear protagonist or antagonist? What interpersonal conflicts are there? |

- Look careful at character descriptions and brainstorm as many surface/depth arguments as possible.
- Don't censor; first list out possible arguments, then reject interpretations with limited support.

<br>

### Setting
- The physical and social environment a text is set is different from the *context* (environment in which the text was written).
  - Both are important to consider, though.
- Good questions to ask:

| Is the time, like time of day or year, significant in any way? |
| Is the location meaningful? Has the space been described in a revealing or suggestive way? |
| How does the weather or climate impact the deeper meaning of the story? |
| What is the spatial relationship of objects? e.g. are they claustrophobic or open? |
| Is anything revealing of furniture or decorations of the setting? |
| Is the lighting significant? |


<br>

<br>

### Perspective
- It may be helpful to identify the viewpoint from which the text is told.
- Paying attention to shifts of perspective can help in finding surface/depth arguments.

| What biases does the narrator or speaker have? |
| What are the implications of the reliability of the narrator? |
| How broad or limited is the narrator's perspective? |
| Are there shifts in the narrator's perspective? |

<br>

<br>

### Comparisons
- The author can use comparisons to describe events, objects, or people.
  - These transfer a set of ideas associated with one object to another.
- Comparisons always have two parts - a subject being described and a set of concepts being transfered from the original object.
- Comparisons do not need to be explicitly stated.
- Good questions to ask:

| What metaphors or smilies does the text use? |
| Is the text an allegory for something else? |
| Do comparisons in the text seem to reverse typical, standard meanings? |

<br>

<br>

### Ironies
- An irony involves a tension between an expected state and the real state.
  - e.g. a firehouse burning down is an irony.
- Three types of ironies;
  - *situational irony* - tension between expected and actual situations.
  - *dramatic irony* - an incongruity between what the audience knows and what a character believes.
  - *verbal irony* - conflicts between the literal meaning of a phrase. 
- Good questions to ask:

| Does the text suggest a tension between our expectations and what actually occurs in the text? |
| How do these ironies shape our understandings of central meanings, themes, and ideas in the text? |
| What surface/depth arguments can be made about these tensions? |

<br>

<br>

### Time and Sequence
- Looking at the way text plays with time or a sequence of events can trigger fruitful ideas about a text's possible meanings.
- How does the sequence of events change order through flashbacks, flash-forwards, etc./
- Questions to ask:

| Does the etext call our attention to the passage of time? |
| Does the text speed time up, or slow it down? What do these time changes indicate? |
| Does the order in which events are presented differ from the actual chronological order of events? |
| What verb tense is used, and do these tenses shift? |

<br>

---

<br>

### Titles and Epigraphs
- Titles and epigraphs (brief quotations from another text as a rpeface) as clues to interpreting deeper meanings.
- Questions to ask:

| What does a title and epigraph suggest about deeper levels of meaning? |
| What research can you do about the title to uncover deeper meanings? |


<br>

---

<br>

### Specific Words
- Words that are unusual or expected, or repeated should be probed further.
- Good questions to ask:

| What are the denotative (literal) meanings of the word? |
| What are the connotative, emotional, or cultural meanings of a word? |
| How does the author make up words or play with grammar? |
| Are words repeated, or is there an unusual pattern? |

<br>

### Sound
- Reading a text aloud can help you hear reptitions, or other aural aspects.
- Some poems are intended to be delivered orally.
- Sound-related issues to look for:

| **Alliteration** is repition of an initial consonant sound. |
| **Assonance** is the repitition of vowel sounds. |
| **Consonance** is the reptition of ending consonants. |
| **Meter**  is the basic rythmic structure of a poem. |
| Are sounds of words suggestive? Are there homophones? |
| Do patterns of rhyme or repeated sounds link ideas? |
| Is the meter or rhyme pattern broken? |

<br>

<br>

### Breaks and Groupings
- Line, chapter, stanza, and scene breaks can provide groupings and separations to analyze.
- Look for:

| Does punctuation call attention to itself? |
| Is there significance to where a scence ends? |
| How do stanzas operate as units of meaning? |
| Is there an enjambment (breaking of a line) in the poetry? |
