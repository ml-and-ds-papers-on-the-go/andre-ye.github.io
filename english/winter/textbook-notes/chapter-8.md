### Introduction
- Considering a text's genre is an important application of a context strategy.
- **Genre** is at term that refers to categories used to group similar texts.
- Texts grouped in a genre share similar purposes, audiences, and conventions.
  - They can, however, differ in how important these three elements are.
- For example, a poetic elegy has a specific purpose of lamenting loss or death, and cann have a specific convention requiring couplets be written with an exact meter.
- Some genres:

| Broad | poetry, fiction, drama, nonfiction, comedy, tragedy, history |
| Poetic | elegy, sonnet, ballad, ode, dramatic, monologue |
| Popular | romance, mystery, horror, western, courtroom, drama |

- Information about genres can be used to make surface/depth arguments.
- Many genres discussed are really **verse forms**, or a poetic structure consisting of patterns in rhyme, meter, or lines.

### Making Arguments About Genre
- Genres contain particular historical and cultural associations.
- Similarly, when reading a sonnet, we read it in the context of other sonnets.
  - A **sonnet** is a fourteen-line poem arranged in rhyme schemes.
  - Typically, there are ten syllables per line.
- Arguments about genre are persuasive when:
  1. They support a clear surface/depth interpretation;
  2. Do not contain extraneous information;
  3. Follow proper citation practices;
  4. Make an argument about the genre.
- There may be contrasts between a piece and its genre that can be analyzed.

### Using Genre to Brainstorm
- Begin by identifying the genre or genres of text you are analyzing.
- Arguments about genre are significant when the author *breaks* or *disrupts* conventions of the genre. Think: what do you expect from the genre?
- Questions to ask yourself about a genre:

| **Cultural associations** | Who usually reads and writes this genre? Is it associated with an ethnic or social group? |
| **Subject matter** | What kinds of subject and content matter does one expect to find int he genre? What conflicts does the genre include? Are there common themes or motifs? |
| **Purpose** | Does the genre have a purpose, like to celebrate or mourn? Does it convey a moral? |
| **Style and tone** | Is the genre dark or light? Does it use elevated diction or plain speech? |
| **Characters or speakers** | Are there "stock" characters typically found in the genre? Are there common personality traits? |
| **Settings** | What settings does the genre usually take place in? |
| **Rhythm, meter, and rhyme** | Is the genre associated with a particular rhyme scheme or meter? Is there an order or pattern the genre is supposed to follow? |

- Next, focus on elements that are missing or seem out of place.
  - Ommitting or changing a common feature associated with the genre;
  - Using the genre to raise subjects or themes usually not associated with it;
  - Combining elements of multiple genres.

### Using Unfamiliar Verse Genres: The Sonnet

#### What is a sonnet?
- Sonnet originates from Italian, and means "little sound" or "little song".
- Characteristics of sonnets:
  - Fourteen lines;
  - Follows a defined rhyme scheme;
  - Typically written in iambic pentameter (five pairs of stressed & unstressed syllables per line);
  - Expresses a single theme or sentiment;
  - Has a shift in sentiment.
- Example of iambic pentameter from SHakespeare's Sonnet 129:

```
˘   ´    ˘     ´    ˘       ´   ˘   ´    ˘  ´
Is per jur'd, mur derous, blood y, full of blame

˘ = unstressed
´ = stressed
```

- Some flexibility is acceptable; e.g. "mur-derous" needs to be pronounced as two syllables for it to work.

#### Petrarchan and Shakespearean sonnets
- There are two main variations of the sonnet form.

| | **Petrarchan** | **Shakespearean** |
| Named after | Franceso Petrarca | William Shakespeare |
| Formation | Eight-line octave with ABBA ABBA rhyme scheme and six-line sestet with flexible rhyme - usually CDECDE or CDCDCD. | Three groups of four lines (quatrains) and a pair of lines (couplet). Rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. |
| Structure | Two parts of the sonnet form an argument; octave describes the problem and sestet proposes a resolution. Ninth line creates a turn. | The third quatrain or the couplet contain an unexpected sharp term; summarizing the theme of the poem and introducing a new look at it. |
| Subject matter | Unattainable love | Love and its torments, time, the immortality of poetry compared to the fleeting beauty of youth. |
