### Introduction
- All literary and cultural analyses work to draw out multiple levels of meaning to show its complexity.
- However, there is a secondary value of literary analysis: **social relevance**.
  - Life and literature must be connected in some way.
  - Literature, regardless of when it was written, can offer wisdom to our modern situation.
- You can write a good literary analysis without indicating social relevance, but many critics do so.
- A first step towards social change lies in exposing social problems and power relations.
  - An argument invoking social relevance gives **exigency** (motivation) for literary analysis beyond simply interpreting the text to broader problems and forces.
- Social relevance usually appears most clearly in the final paragraphs of the essay.
- Using social relevance can work in two ways:
  1. Inform topic choice or what to look for;
  2. A strategy to draw out in the essay to show how a work is socially relevant.

### Using Social Relevance to Brainstorm
- Prominent topics and concerns in literary scholarship:
  - Gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc.
  - Oppressed and marginalized groups participating in thier own oppression
  - Nationalism or national identity, postcolonial works
  - Power and power struggle
  - Interpretation to understand our position in society
  - Boundaries between self and other
  - Relationships between past and present
  - Relationships between human and natural
- Think of connections between the text you are analyzing and one or more of these topics.

### Using Social Relevance to Write Persuasively
- Critics are more explicit about the contemporary social relevance in their concluding paragraphs.
- They "step back" after persuading readers to see new layers of meaning in text.
  - e.g. by combining an argument about self and other with a statement on consumer culture, the analysis becomes socially relevant.

### How Social Relevance Works with other Strategies of Literary Analysis
- Social relevance works hand-in-hand with other literary analysis strategies that have been discussed.

| **Surface/depth and social relevance work together.** | Social relevance needs to uncover nonobvious complexities in a text. |
| **Patterns and social relevance uncover social problems embedded in a text.** | Problems can be uninetended by the author, or reoccur throughout the literary work. |
| **Context and social relevance show how a text reveals something about culture/society.** | Utilizing social relevance can connect contextual information into a socially relevant point and continued legacies of the past. |

### Criticism CHanges Over Time
- Prior to the 20th century, literary criticism was focused on biography or linguistics.
- Early 20th century, **New Criticism** advocated for interpretations that focused on only the text and its meaning.
- New membership into English studies began to diversify; new works and methods of interpretations were considered and aopted.
- Modern literary criticism no longer treats texts as isolated objects, but instead parts of a network of social forces.
- **Criticism will continue to change.**
