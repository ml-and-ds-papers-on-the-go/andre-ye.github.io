## Introduction
- Communities with conversations about texts are *discourse communities*; a group of people that share basic values and ground rules about communication procedures.

## Discourse Communities as Parlors
- Academic discourse communities are *ongoing* conversations. They build upon and are informed by what others have said.
  - Conversations go on before and after you come.
- Academic papers are *similar* to conversations; one may extend, refine, or argue against certain ideas.
  - However, these 'textual conversations' are much slower than face-to-face discussions.
  
## Why Join the Critical Conversation on Literature?
- If you major in English, you'll find these practices not defined in explicit terms, but they will envertheless show up in lectures, discussions, essays, etc.
- If you are not majoring in English, understanding conversations of literary critics will prepare you to join conversations in other discourse communities.
- Skills of literary analysis help you live a thoughtful, reflective, and ethical life.
  - Interpreting texts helps us understand ourselves and the world.
  
## Texts and their Authors and Critics

### "Text" in literary and cultural analysis
- Some distinguish literary works and popular books and films; however, English studies is questioning this.
- What separates the discourse community of literary studies is not *what* critics say, but what kinds of analysis and questions they use.
- **text** refers to any literary or cultural work the literary critic analyzes.
- **literary analysis** is the analysis of all sorts of literature, including contemporary books, movies, TV shows, and stories.

### Author vs literary critic
- **author** is used to refer to the writer of a primary text.
- **literary critic** or **critic** refers to person writing the literary analysis of the text.
