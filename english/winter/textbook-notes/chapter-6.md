### Introduction
- Literary critics value interpretations on how a text is complex.
- One productive strategy for discovering complex interpretations is to look for opposites in a text.
- Interpretations that break down opposites are valued in literary studies because they influence how we see the world.
- Searching for arguments about opposites in a text is usually productive; this search usually leads to other insights to help you find a complex argument about a text.

### Opposites and Irony
- Irony occurs when two states or meanings are in tension.
- Irony *exposes tensions*, but the opposites strategy breaks down these tensions, and changes how we see the concepts.
- The opposites argument may begin by noting an ironic tension, but goes further to produce a more complex argument.

### Using Opposites to Brainstorm
- Look for concepts, ideas, patterns, characters, or settings that appear to be in tension.
- Common opposites or tensions:

| life/death | natural/unnatural | male/female |
| strong/weak | self/other | inside/outside |
| youth/age | love/hate | truth/deception |

- A **binary opposition** can provide a productive starting place for looking for complex arguments in a text.
- Many binary oppositions have a *hierarchy*; i.e. one of two terms is vieweda s superior to another. 
  - For example, natural is superior to unnatural, truth is superior to deception.
  - Arguments using the opposites strategy can complicate these generally simplistic hierarchies.
- Things we identify as opposites *can often have many similarities*.
  - Noticing these similarities help us discver complex arguments.
  - One can look towards what something is not to define what it is.

### Using Opposites to Write Persuasively
- When critics use the opposites strategy, their arguments usually have several steps.
  1. Note oppositions as a tension in the text (usually through surface/depth).
  2. Provide textual evidence that elaborates on these tensions.
  3. Explain how the text subverts a normal way of looking at these opposites.
- A **paradoxical statement** is an assertion that may seem to be self-contradictory but also appears to contain a truth.
- Paradoxes call attention to competing value systems; they show how neither set of values is absolute.
  - They can challenge how we see the world, and cause us to reflect more deeply.
- Paradoxes enable us to argue for the **social relevance** of our analyses.
  - Social relevance is the assumption that life and literature are connected.
  - Literature can help us understand our contemporary social situation.
