### Introduction
- "Self" is a strange idea - obvious to commonsense but vague to the philosopher.
- Is there some essential self inside us we need to put into words?
  - Do we need to tell ourselves about ourselves? What function does self-telling serve?
- 20th-century answer: much of ourselves is unconsciously defended from conscious probings by concealments and distortions.
  - We need to find ways around these defenses - a psychoanalyst to help overcome our resistance to discover ourselves.
- There is still unfinished business - why do we need to tell stories to elucidate what it means by "self"?
- **There is no such thing as an intuitively obvious and essential self to know** - one that sits to be portrayed by words.
  - We constantly construct and reconstruct a self to meet the needs of situations we encounter.
- We do not need to make up stories from scratch every time; our self-making stories accumulate over time.
  - **Our memories become victims of self-making stories.**
  - Self-making is a narrative art - uneasily constrained.
- **Self-making is from both the inside and the outside.**
  - **Inside** - memory, feelings, ideas, beliefs, subjectivity.
  - **Outside** - apparent esteem of others, expectations, culture.
- Narrative acts of self-making are **guided by implicit cultural models of selfhood**.
  - We are not necessarily *slaves* of culture; there are too many ambiguous models of selfhood that even simpler cultures can offer.
  - All cultures provide presuppositions and perspectives about selfhood.
- These cultural models still leave room for maneuver; self-making is our principal means for establishing our uniqueness.
  - We compare our accounts to the accounts of others.
  - We are always mindful of the differences between what we tell ourselves about ourselves and *what we reveal to others*.
- **Telling others about oneself is no simple matter.**
  - Depends on what we think *they think* we ought to be like.
  - Our self-making narratives reflect others' expectations.
  - Selfhood becomes *res publica* (of the state, the common) even when talking about ourselves.
- **Self is also other**.
  - Roman art of rhetoric - arguing convincingly to others - is turned eventually to self-telling.
- **Is there a spiraling effect in this? - is self-making a sport of institutions of culture?**
  - Do we invent tools to further our cultural bent - then become servants of those tools?
- Will guardedness obscure the tender side of selfhood? The shape of selfhood is no longer a private issue.

### The Publicity of Selfhood
- Endless books tell us how to improve selfhood - how to keep from becoming divided, narcissistic, isolated.
  - Research psychologists warn us of errors in judging self.
- Has self not always been a matter of the public, moral concern?
  - Confessions of sins and appropriate penance purged the soul.
- The good self has been an issue in the cockpit of secular moral debate.
  - Does education make the spirit more generous by broadening the mind?
  - Does selfhood become richer by exposure?
- Inviolate selfhood is the basis of human freedom - our selves are among the most impressive workers of literary art humans create.
- Self-making and self-telling are as public as private acts can be.

### Selfhood as Storymaking
- Why do we naturally portray ourselves through story - that selfhood is a product of our story-making?
- Selfhood of the Self:
```
1. It is teleological, replete with desires, intentions, aspirations, endlessly in pursuit of goals.
2. In consequence, it is sensitive to obstacles: responsive to success or failure, unsteady in handling uncertain outcomes.
3. It responds to its judged successes and failures by altering its aspirations and ambitions and changing its reference group (Bruner, 1991).
4. It relies on selective remembering to adjust the past to the demands of the present and the anticipated future.
5. It is oriented toward “reference groups” and “significant others” who provide the cultural standards by which it judges itself.
6. It is possessive and extensible, adopting beliefs, values, loyalties, even objects as aspects of its own identity.
7. Yet, it seems able to shed these values and possessions as required by circumstances without losing its continuity.
8. It is experientially continuous over time and circumstances, despite striking transformations in its contents and activities.
9. It is sensitive to where and with whom it finds itself in the world.
10. It is accountable and sometimes responsible for formulating itself in words, becoming troubled when words cannot be found.
11. It is moody, affective, labile, and situation sensitive.
12. It is coherence seeking and coherence guarding, eschewing dissonance and contradiction through highly developed psychic procedures.
```
- Translated into elements of a story, it becomes:
```
1. A story needs a plot.
2. Plots need obstacles to the goal.
3. Obstacles make people reconsider.
4. Tell only about the story-relevant past.
5. Give your characters allies and connections.
6. Let your characters grow.
7. But keep their identity intact.
8. And also keep their continuity evident.
9. Locate your characters in the world of people.
10. Let your characters explain themselves as needed.
11. Let your characters suffer moods.
12. Characters should worry when not making sense.
```
- Does selfhood require more than a reasonably well-wrought story?
- If selfhood the origin of storytelling, or vice-versa?
- "Thinking is for speaking" - one cannot verbalize experience without taking perspective, and language favors perspectives.
- Selfhood is a verbalized event - a meta event that provides coherence and continuity in "the scramble of experience".
- Not just language but narrative that shapes its use.

### The Incompleteness of Self-telling
- Most people never get around to composing a complete autobiography.
- Self-telling is provoked by episodes related to a longer-term concern.
- No autobiography is completed, only ended; what we write is only one version of self-telling.
- We are **forever balancing what was with what might have been**.
- Autobiography teaches us about what we leave implicit and what their notion of self is.

### The Evolution of Life-writers and Perspectives on Self-Telling
- **St. Augustine** saw autobiography as a search for true life, self, memory, and reality.
  - Life is given God and Providence; true memory mirrors the real world.
  - Narrative realism and the Self that emerges is a gift of Revelation.
- **Giambattista Vico** saw life as crafted by the mental acts of those who live by it, not an act of God.
- **Jean-Jacques Rosseau** raised new doubts about Augustine's stable narrative realism.
  - Life stories were social games rather than quests for a higher truth.
- **Samuel Beckett** - rejected narrative as reflecting the order of life, or that there is inherent order.
  - Life is problematic, not to be shackled in conventional genres.
  - Let one be not lulled by the illusion of narrative.
- The issue of selfhood has not diminished over a millennium.
- Virginia Woolf's "room of one's own" - feminist appeal for a change in women's conceptions of selfhood.
- No image of selfhood ever gains a monopoly.

### Self-making Narrative as a Balancing Act
- It must create a conviction of autonomy - a will, freedom - but also relate one to a world of others.
  - Implicit commitment to others that limits our autonomy.
- Characters and events in folk stories serve as functions in narrative plots - they do not exist on their own.
- Is the topic of balancing natural?
- Commitment to conditions is a narrative - dominated by obligations in one's life.
  - One's self-narrative is lacking in imagined possible worlds.

> "The balancing act between commitment and autonomy no longer satisfies as the range of possibilities narrow."

- One rarely encounters autobiographies without turning points.
  - Are they integral to growing up?
- **Self-narrating is from the outside in as well as from the inside out.**
  - Self-making through self-narrating is endless and restless.

### The Necessity of Self-Narrative
- We are rather like a "cast of characters"; literary exaggeration and inner voices coming to terms with each other.
  - Torn between the familiar and the possible.
- Why do we need narrative for self-definition?
  - Narrative gift is distinctively human - our natural way of using language.

> "Self is a product of our telling and not some essence to be delved for in the recesses of subjectivity."

- The construction of selfhood cannot proceed without a capacity to narrate.
- We can produce selfhood that joins us with others when we narrate.
