### Revising Versus Editing
- **Revising:** making changes to a paper to *reflect new thinking or conceptualizing.*
- **Editing:** minor chnages to what the final draft of the paper will be.
  - e.g. correcting misspellings, substituting dashes
- Nicities of style, spelling, and punctuation are not priorities in first and second draft.
  - Develop an argument with evidence.
  - Don't worry about editing early on.

| Revising | Editing |
| --- | --- |
| Writing is a work in progress. | Writing is an almost-finished product. |
| New possibilities in and beyond the text. | Obvious errors and deficiencies. |
| New questions or goals. | Draft, not new avenues of discussion. |
| Purpose and reader's needs. | Grammar, punctuation, spelling, style. |
| Further discovery. | Polishing up essay. |

### The Peer Editing Process
The composition pyramid:

| Level | Considering |
| --- | --- |
| Top | Situation, Issues, Thesis, Audience |
| Middle | Organization, use of sources to support thesis |
| Bottom | Style and grammar |

### Working With Early Drafts
#### Understand the Writer's Responsibilities
- Focus on top-level pyramid concerns.
  - Situation, issue, thesis, audience.
- Template:
  1. What is your question?
  2. What is the issue motivating you to write?
  3. How have published writers addressed the issue you discuss?
  4. What is your working thesis?
  5. Who is your audience, and how do you want them to respond?
  6. What do you think is working well?
  7. What specific aspect of the essay are you least satisfied with?
  8. What kind of feedback do you especially want?

#### Understand the Reader's Responsibilities
- As a reader, **follow along as the early draft is read.**
- Have a conversation about your reactions.
  - Don't jump in and tell the writer what he or she *should* be doing.
- Offer **positive and negative** remarks.
- Template:
  1. Are the questions and issues that motivate the writer clear?
  2. Has the writer effectively described the conersation that published writers are engaged in?
  3. What is at issue?
  4. What is the writer's thesis?
  5. Is the writer addressing the audience's concerns effectively?
  6. What passages of the draft are most effective?
  7. What passages of the draft are least effective?

### Working with Later Drafts
#### Understand the Writer's Responsibilities
- State your thesis more definitively than with an earlier draft.
- Support your thesis with evidence.
  - Anticipate possible counterarguments.

#### Understand the Reader's Responsibilities
- Focus as a reader should be mid-level concerns.
  - Places in the writer's text that are confusing or requie better transitions.
- Play the role of *naive reader*.
  - Is something unclear?
  - Challenge the writer.

### Working with Final Drafts
##z4# Understand the Writer's Responsibilities
- Final draft is **editing**, not **revising.**
  1. What is your unique perspective on your issue?
  2. To what extent do the words and phrases you use reflect who you believe your readers are?
  3. Does your style of citation reflect accepted conventions for academic writing?
  4. What do you think is working best?
  5. What specific aspect of the essay are you least satisfied with at this time?

#z4## Understand the Reader's Responsibilities
- Bottom-level of the compositional pyramide.
  - Style and grammar.
- Details are important.
  - Is this the best word to use?
  - Could this sentence be split into two?
