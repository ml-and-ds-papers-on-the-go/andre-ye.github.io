- Academic writing explores complex issues and questions.
- Readers expect academic writers to be clear, specific, and logical.
- The logical stand is the **thesis**.
  - An assertion writers make at the beginning of their essay.
  - A thesis encompasses all information writers use to further their arguments.
- Thesis runs through every paragraph, holding the paragraphs together, like a shish kebab.
  - Should reflect awareness from the conversation and convey a fresh perspective.

### Working vs Definitive Theses
- Question serves as a tool for inquiry that will help formulate a working thesis.
  - First attempt at an assertion.
- Valuable in earlys tages; allows you to read selectively.
- **Never accept your working thesis as your final position.**
  - Continue testing your assertion as you read and write.
  - A definitive thesis will come when we are satisfied that the issue has been examined from multiple perspectives.

### Developing a Working Thesis: Four Models
#### The Correcting Misinterpretatinos Model
- Used to correct writers whose arguments have misconstrued one or more important aspects of an issue.
- Takes the form of a factual claim: although *x*, *y*.
```
Although scholars have addressed curriculum to explain low achievement in schools, they have failed to fully appreciate the impact of limited resources to fund up-to-date textbooks, quality teachers, and computers. Therefore, reform in schools must focus on economic need as well as curriculum.
```

#### The Filling the Gap Model
- Points to what other authors have overlooked or ignored.
- Makes a claim of value.
```
If America is truly a “melting pot” of cultures, as it is often called, then why is it that stories and events seem only to be in black and white? Why is it that when history courses are taught about the period of the civil rights movement, only the memoirs of African Americans are read, like those of Melba Pattillo Beals and Ida Mae Holland? Where are the works of Maxine Hong Kingston, who tells the story of alienation and segregation in schools through the eyes of a Chinese child? African Americans were denied the right to vote, and many other citizenship rights; but Chinese Americans were denied even the opportunity to become citizens. Although it is important not to diminish the issue of discrimination against African Americans or belittle the struggles they go through, it is important to call attention to discrimination against other minority groups and their often-overlooked struggles to achieve equality.
```

#### The Modifying What Others Have Said Model
- Assumes that mutual understanding is possible.
- A modification is proposed to an existing idea; building a constructive conversation on work that is valued.
```
Although scholars have claimed that the only sure way to reverse the cycle of homelessness in America is to provide an adequate education, we need to build on this work by providing school-to-work programs that ensure graduates have access to employment.
```

#### The Hypothesis Testing Model
- Begins with the assumption that writers may have good reasons for supporting their arguments, but there are good reasons why somethign is or is not the case.
- Hypotheses are simple, with a single problem and solution.

### Establishing a Context for a Thesis
- Writers need to provide **context** for the claim they make.
- Establishing a background involves several steps.
  1. Establish that the topic of covnersation is current and relevant.
  2. Briefly summarize what others have said.
  3. Explain what you see is the problem, perhaps by raising questions.
  4. State your thesis, suggesting it may present something new to the readers.
- Your readers should come away with the first part of your essay knowing why you are discussing the issue.
