### Identifying Types of Claims
#### Identifying Claims of Fact
- `Claims of fact` are assertions that *define or classify something into a problem or condition*.
- Claims are more objective (but not pure fact), so are easier to verify.
  - Based on *interpretations* of evidence gathered from different sources.
  - Can also define or classify claims of fact.
- Examples:
  - "It's sunny in Seattle." - a factual claim of fact and easily verified. Also not very interesting.
  - "Heavy regulations on the American automobile industry set Japanese car companies on a track for eventual success." Argues that a problem *has* existed. Difficult to verify, but interesting.
  - "Images of violence in the media create a culture of violence in schools."
- **When reading, continually evaluate evidence to determine if it is enough to persuade you in favor of an assertion.**

#### Identifying Claims of Value
- `Claims of value` express an evaluation of a problem or condition.
  - Condition good or bad? Important or unimportant?
- Claim of value can be expressed through value words: *immoral*, *ethical*, etc.
  - Can also be conveyed through tone and attitude.
> Current use of social media favors affinity over engagement, expression over debate, silence over disagreement, dogmatism over compromise, and—toward opponents—disdain over respect. -[Radcliffe](https://andre-ye.github.io/english/essay-notes/why-arents-social-media-delivering-democracy)
- Examples
  - "The increase in homelessness is a deplorable situation that contradicts the whole idea of democracy."
  - "The media are biased, which means we cannot count on newspapers or television news for the truth."
  

#### Identifying Claims of Policy
- `Claims of policy` say that a condition *should* exist - a solution to a problem.
  - Oftened signaled by 'should' and 'must'.
- Not all writers make claims of policy explicitly.
- Examples
  - "Taxing the use of fossil fuels will end the energy crisis." Is a policy prescription to solve a problem.
  - "We should reform the welfare system to ensure that people who receive support from the government also work."

### Analyzing Arguments
- Analyzing an argument involves identifying the writer's main and minor claims by examining:
  1. the reasons and evidence to support each claim
  2. concessions
  3. attempts to handle counterarguments
  4. presence of logical fallacies

#### Analyzing Reasons Used to Support a Claim
- Stating a claim vs. supporting a claim: different.
  - Has the writer proposed *good reasons* for their position?

#### Is the source recent?
- Readers will expect you to cite recent evidence
  - Published within 5 years of when you are writing.
- Old research can also be valuable.

#### Is the source relevant?
- Anecdotal evidence may alert to a possible topic and help connect with readers. - Need to prove the **relevance** of that experience.
  - Is it pertinent?
  - Is it typical of a large situation or condition?
- If you're not comparing things in depth, your **argument will be flawed*.

#### Is the source reliable?
- Need to evaluate whether data you use is reliable.
  - Some researchers present findings based on a small sample of people.
- Look for **authoritative sources** and **expert testimony**.

#### Is the source accurate?
- Do a little digging and find who else has made a similar claim.
- Accuracy of statistics can be difficult to verify.
  - Make sure stats sources are authoritative and reliable.
    - Government and major research universities are usually safe.
  - Make sure whoever is interpreting statistical info is not distorting it.

### Identifying Concessions
- A **concession** is an acknowledgement that readers may not agree with every point the writer makes.
- Example concession signalling:
  - "It is true that..."
  - "*X* and *Y* are true, but *Z* must be considered."
  - "Some studies have convincingly shown that..."
- Writers will usually go on to address the concession.

<br>

### Identifying Counterarguments
- A counterargument is an argument in response to an argument.
- Anticipate reader's objections.
- An argument should be more **conversational than confrontational.**
  - Establish common ground.
  - Seek to understand opposing views.
  - Make concessions and respond to counterarguments.

#### Rogerian Approach to Argument
1. Convey to readers that their different views are understood.
2. Acknowledge conditions under which that view is valid.
3. Assist the reader in finding common ground.
4. Create mutually acceptable solutions on clearly defined problems.

### A Model for Analyzing Arguments
- **Analyzing a claim of fact.** How does the author define terms and assert claims of fact they intend to make the reader accept?
- **Using evidence to support a claim.** How does the author use authority to strengthen evidence?
- **Making a concession.** How does the author anticipate opposing views, acknowledge them, and find common ground?
- **Providing counterarguments.** How does the author make rebuttal counterarguments against opposing arguments?

### Recognizing Logical Fallacies
- Logical fallacies are flaws in a chain of reasoning.
- 15 logical fallacies.
  1. **Erroneous Appeal to Authority.**
    - An erroneous authority is an author who claims to be an authority but is not.
    - The claim may be true, but there is no reason to accept it.
  2. **Ad Hominem.**
    - Focuses on the person making the claim, instead of the claim itself.
    - "Of course Senator X supports oil drilling in Alaska - he's in the pocket of oil companies!"
  3. **Shifting the Issue.**
    - Author draws attention away from the issue instead of offering evidence.
  4. **Either/Or Fallacy.**
    - Author will take two extreme positions and force the reader to make a choice.
    - "Either you support war or are against it."
  5. **Sweeping Generalizations.**
    - Author attempts to draw a conclusion without providing sufficient evidence.
  6. **Bandwagon.**
    - Author uses support of others to justify your support.
    - "Harvard, Stanford, and Berkeley have added a multicultural component to their graduation requirements. Other institutions should hence do the same."
  7. **Begging the Question.**
    - Advances a circular argument that asks readers to accept a premise that is also the conclusion readers are expected to raw.
  8. **False Analogy.**
    - Authors persuade us that something is true by using a comparison that is not reasonable.
  9. **Technical Jargon.**
    - Jargon boosts up the author's credibility artificially without saying anything.
  10. **Confusing Cause and Effect.**
    - Difficult to establish one factor influenced another.
  11. **Appeal to Fear.**
    - Appealing to irrational fears and prejudices to prevent them from thinking critically about them.
    - Linked to confusing cause and effect.
  12. **Fallacy of Division.**
    - Suggests what is true of a whole must always be true of its parts.
  13. **Hasty Generalization.**
    - Draws a conclusion about a group with a sample size too small to be representative.
  14. **Straw Man Argument.**
    - Makes a generalization about what a group believes without actually citing a specific writer or work.
  15. **Fallacy of the Middle Ground.**
    - Assumes that the middle position beteen extreme positions must be correct.
    - While it may be true, needs to be justified with evidence.
