### Writing a Synthesis
- To compose an effective synthesis, you must:
  1. make connections among ideas in different texts.
  2. decide what those connections mean.
  3. formulate the gist of what you've read, much like a summary.
- The gist should be a uccint statement that brings into focus *not a central idea* but relationships between the texts.
- Syntheses can be ued to fulfill a rhetorical purpose of offering a correction to what others have written, identifying a gap, etc.
- **Your role as a writer is to bring about awareness, influence readers' understanding of assumptions, and to challenge readers to think in new ways**.
- Writing a synthesis is a strategy for framing your argumnet.

#### Steps to Writing a Synthesis
1. **Make connections between and among different texts.** Annotate the texts you are working with from an eye of comparison.
2. **Decide what those connections mean and how you want readers to understand them.** Decide what similarities and differences mean to you and what they might mean to readers.
3. **Formulate the gist of what you've read.** Identify an overarching idea.

### Avoiding Plagiarism
- When sources are integrated into writing, it is essential that the sources be acknowledged.
  - Academic requires document sources to be ued appropriately.
- It is only fair to acknowledge your sources.
- Plagiarism is a serious breach of academic integrity.
- Watch out for accidental/uniintentional plagiarism; expressing the content of a passage without using original words is an 'invitation to plagiarism'.
- Your paper should sound like it was written by you.

#### Principles Governing Plagiarism
1. All written work is accepted as your work.
2. The wording of something you submit is taken to be your own.
3. Concepts and ideas given in a paper are assumed to have originated from you.
4. Online materials used for a paper also apply to these principles.
5. Writing can be corrected and revised with reference books or with a peer group, but it cannot have been revised substantially by someone else.

#### Steps to Avoiding Plagiarism
1. **Always cite the source.** Signal that you are paraphrasing, summariziing, synthesizing, or quoting your sources.
2. **Provide a full citation in the bibliography.** A full citation must be provided at the end of every paper.

### Integrating ources into Your Writing
- As a writer, you can chooe how you integrate the ideas of others into your own argument (ummary, paraphrase, or quote).
  - This is all reliant on your purpose as a writer.
- When you quote a passage, it
  1. offers evidence that legitimizes your own argument,
  2. puts a relevant idea in a new light
  3. provokes thoughts that help explain your justifications
  4. are a jumping off point for your argument.
- Although shorter quotes are usually preferred, a longer quote can sometimes serve your purpose.
- Keep two things in mind when integrating sources:
  - Identify the source of information
  - Take an active stance by explaining the significance of the information
    - Take control of your writing, and do not take evidence selectively.

### Using Quotations
- When quotations are integrated into writing, you represent the voices of others.
  - Lead the reader step-by-step.

#### Using Signal Phrases to Introduce Quotation
- A method of making shorter quotations part of sentences.
- A signal phrase - brief introducing phrase - is required.
```
According to Jane Doe, "over 200% of chickens produce spinach" (495).
"Over 200% of chickens," Jane Doe write, "produce spinach" (495).
Jane Doe's studies reveal a shocking phenomenon: "Over 200% of chickens produce spinach" (495).
```

#### Common Verbs in Signal Phrases

| agrees | concludes | emphasizes | maintains | recommends |
| argues | counters | explains | notes | responds |
| asserts | declares | illustrates | observes | reveals |
| claims | demontrates | implies | points out | tates |
| comments | disagrees | indicates | proposes | takes issue with |
| compares | disputes | insists | questions | writes |

#### Indicate Changes and Omissions in Quotations
- Use square brackets to let readers know that words are not original.
- Use an ellipsis if any words are ommitted from the quotation.
- The sentence must read grammatically and represent the author's intensions.

#### Set Off Long Quotations as Block Quotations
- If the quotation is longer than four lines, place it in a "block quoation" by indenting it.

#### Steps to Integrating Sources Into Your Writing
1. **Take an active stance.** You guide where your paper is going, not your sources.
2. **Explain the source.** Explain the material you quote, paraphrase, or summarize.
3. **Be fair to your sources.** Do not unfairly represent the content, and show what you change with ellipses and brackets.
4. **Use signal phrases to introduce and identify the source.** Use short quotations with the grammar of your own sentences.
