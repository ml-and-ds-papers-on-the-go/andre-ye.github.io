## Writing a Synthesis
- To compose an effective synthesis, you must:
  1. make connections among ideas in different texts.
  2. decide what those connections mean.
  3. formulate the gist of what you've read, much like a summary.
- The gist should be a uccint statement that brings into focus *not a central idea* but relationships between the texts.
- Syntheses can be ued to fulfill a rhetorical purpose of offering a correction to what others have written, identifying a gap, etc.
- **Your role as a writer is to bring about awareness, influence readers' understanding of assumptions, and to challenge readers to think in new ways**.
