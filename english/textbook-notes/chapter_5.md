### Identifying Issues
- How to identify a particular issue.
- Issues do not simply exist in the world in a clean formation.
- Writers must construct issues from situations.

#### Draw Upon Personal Experience
- Personal experiences influence how we read, what we pay attention to, and what inferences we draw.
- Use personal experience to argue a point.
  - Don't just tell a story.
  - Strengthen your argument with the story.
- Puts a human touch on your essay.

#### Identify What is Open to Dispute
- Think of an issue as a *fundamental tension* between 2 or more conflicting points of view.
- Teach readers about conditions in your own writing.
  - Widens lens of the problem.

#### Resist Binary Thinking
- Tease out complexities that may be immediately apparent.
  - Resist either/or fallacy.
- A real issue may combine multiple arguments, or maybe one solution alone cannot fix the issue.

#### Build On and Extend the Ideas of Others
- Academic writing challenges but also builds and extends ideas.
- Connect a personal response to a larger one about democracy, fairness, and education.
- Refine the sense of what is at issue, then shape the argument.

#### Read to Discover a Writer's Frame
- One can build upon and extend the ideas of others by discovering a **writer's frame.**
  - This is the perspective through which the writer presents the argument.
- Writers that use framing strategies call to attention conversations that set up arguments.
  - Often quoting specific theories or ideas from authors.

#### Consider the Constraints of the Situation
- Understand the contexts in which it is raised and debated.
- Consider the *audience*.
  - What are the potential readers involved in the dialogue, and what do they know and need to know?
- What form does the response take?
  - Editorial? Letter?
- Situation can function as a major constraint from ethical standpoint.

### Formulating Issue-Based Questions 
- When you identify an issue, you need to understand it in the context of its situation. 
  - An issue does not exist apart from what people value.
- The situation and the issue should be both relevant and timely.
  - These will make the task of connecting to your audience much easier when you write about the issue.
- Think about why the issue matters to you and why it might matter to others.
  - Be prepared to **make the issue relevant.**

#### An Issue-Based Question Can Help...
- Clarify what you know about the issue.
- Guide your inquiry with a clear focus.
- Organize your inquiry around a specific issue.
- Develop an argument by asking How, Why, Should.
- Consider who your argument is.
- Determine resources you have to answer a qeustion.

#### Good Questions
- A good question develops from an issue.
  - A fundamental tension that is identified in the conversation

#### The Process
1. Refine your topic. 
  - The **topic** is the subject you want to write about.
    - Homelessness, tests, violence. 
  - A specific topic needs to be refined into an issue before it can be effectively explored.
2. Explain your interest in the topic.
  - Look at facts and interesting ideas.
3. Identify an issue.
  - Find a place of disagreement. 
4. Formulate your topic as a question.
  - Redirect your topic as a question that points towards an argument.
5. Acknowledge your audience.
