## Introduction
- Do students learn as much when they read digitally as they do in print? (para. 1)
- The answer to this question carries significant weight, but is more than a yes/no response. (para. 2-3) 

## Reading in Print Versus Digitally
- In her research, Baron has compared print and screen reading experiences. (para. 1)
- Findings of study: print was judged to be easier on the eyes, more enjoyable, and less likely to result in multitasking or distraction. (para. 5-6)
- Respondents also praised attributes of reading on a screen, including saving paper, the ability to multitask, and reading in the dark. (para. 7)

## Meauring Learning
- Are students learning as much when they read onscreen? (para. 8)
- Many studies ask people to read text and test for comprehension, finding that participants perform relatively same on text or on screen. (para. 9-10)
- The notion of learning, however, is too simplistic. We need to measure *understanding*, not recall or anwering quetions. (para. 11)
  - Studies that consider this nuance find that reading in print yields better results. (para. 12)
- Students spent less time when reading a passage onscreen and performed worse on tests. (para. 13)

## Critical Thinking and Reading
- Students need to be comfortable with text to develop critical thinking skills in a literate society (para. 16).
  - Being distracted or going to quickly are problems, not advantages.
- Comprehension studies tell us a bit about reading mediums suitable for serious thinking. (para. 18)
  - Alternative: ask students about digital and paper-based reading patterns.
- Most participants felt that they concentrated best in print. (para. 20)
  - Students believed print was a better medium for learning. (para. 21)

## Digital is Convenient and Cheaper
- Other factors influence student's decisions about which reading medium to use. (para. 24)
- Convenience is important; screen-reading offers eaier access. (para. 25)
- Money is another consideration. (para. 26)

## Adapted to Digital Learning
- Growing trend of universities to adapt curricula towards skimming and scanning. (para. 28)
- How can universities help students read text critically? (para. 30)
- **Adaptation**: teaching students to be mindful can help in learning. (para. 31)
- Alternatively, adapt digital software and hardware to paper; annotation programs, page-flipping approximations, etc. (para. 32)
- Short-and-to-the-point is not compatible with critical thinking. (para. 33)
