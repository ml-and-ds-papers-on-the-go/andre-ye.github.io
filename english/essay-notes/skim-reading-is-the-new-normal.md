## Introduction
- The iPad is the "new pacifier". (para. 1)
- An invisible tranformation links everyone together: the circuit that determines how we read is changing.
- This has implication for everyone, from the toddler to the adult.

## Neuroscience and the Threat to Deep Reading
- Acquisition of literacy required a new circuit for processing information. (para. 2)
- Evolved from a simple mechanism for decoding infromation to an elaborative reading brain.
- Our reading brain enables the development of some of our most important intellectual processes.
- Research shows that these "deep reading" processes may be under threat.
- Not a simple issue of print vs. digital reading. (para. 3)
  - Shelly Turkle: society is not at error when it innovates, but when it ignores what it has left behind while innovating.
  - Society needs to confront a diminishingr eading cricuit.

## The Degredation of the Human Reading Circuit
- The human reading circuit is not given through a *genetic blueprint.* (para. 4)
  - It needs and environment, and will adapt to it.
- If the medium is well-suited for large volumes of information, the result is less attention.
- Increasing reports from educators and researchers confirm this.
- Mark Edmundson decribes how students avoid classic literature because they have no patience to read those texts. (parwa. 5)
  - Concerns with "cognitive impatience" and inability to process large quantitie of information.
- Digital screen use can lead to many negative consequences on reading comprehension of high school & college students. (para. 6)
  - Students that read on print were superior in comprehension.
- Ziming Liu (San Jose State University): the new norm is *skimming* (browing). (para. 7)
  - Reduces the time spent during deep reading. Cannot grasp complexity, contemplate the depth, or appreciate beauty.
  
## Reading Medium and Physicality
- Physicality - the sense of touch in print reading - may add important "redundancy" to information. (para. 8)
- Humans need a knowledge of where they are in time and space. 
- US Media Reearchers examined effects of information mediums on the young.
  - Negative effects of reading on a screen appear as early as 4th or 5th grade.
  - Affect comprehension *and* growth of empathy.
- Unintentional damage is produced because of our digital culture. (para. 10)
  - Atrophy of critical analysis impacts us all.

## Conclusion
- Neuroscience rule: use it or loe it; implies *choice*. (para. 11)
  - If we understand what we lose, there is reason for excitement.
- We need to cultivcate a 'bi-literal' reading brain capable of deep thought on newer mediums. (para. 12)
