## Introduction
- Consider: "heart, spark, spirit"; what drives this? (para. 1)
  - Certainly not isolation; individual growth is only possible with interactions.
- Many of us already know the value of creating interactions. (para. 2)
  - We quetion familiar habits, overcome doubt.
  - Spiritual healing: an ongoing proces on becoming more conscious.
- However, we are slow to apply these learnings in the public sphere. (para. 2)
  - We need to modify our outlook and behavior.
  - We also need to *confront* institutions, individuals, powers, and principlaities.
  - We can stay quiet and doubtful because of fear of entity-individual balance.
- It is **just as important to growth to create interactions in the public space a it is in the private one.** (para. 4)
  - In the collective, you will be able to *better understand yourself.*
- You begin to find who you really are. (para. 5)
  > We become human only in the company of other human beings.
  - Open your hearts and give voice to your deepest convictions.
  
## The Cost of Silence
- Derrick Bell took an unpaid protest leave (Harvard Law School African American profesor) (para. 6).
  - Refused to teach until the school hired a minority woman.
  - Bell had long campaigned for it; after three years, the school forced him to resign.
- Bell was not defeated; his public stance preserved his identity and integrity. (para. 7)
  - Failures can actually be factors that bolster who we are.
- Silence is the "ultimate sacrifice" - the "erosion of our spirit". (para. 8)
  - When we stifle our emotions in personal life, we grow numb and dead to the world.
- If we mute our voices given what is happening, we risk the decay of our humanity. (para. 9)
- Social involvement reverses this process; releases choked-off energy. (para. 10)
  - Allan Luks "helper's high" - people who volunteer in communities experience significantlyg reater pleasure and increased energy.
- Parker Palmer (sociologist) - describes the resulting unleashing of truth, vision, and strength. (para. 11)
  - Nothing would have been worse than to stop acting differently from the outside what they knew to bve true inside.

## Learned Helplessnes
- American culture insists little activism matters. (para. 12)
  - Encourages leaving 'important decision to others', be it corporate leaders or foreign social activists.
  - 2008 presidental campaign - challenged the trend of passivity in activism by inpiring citzens to volunteer in ways that shifted the presidential race.
  - It's easier to sit on the sidelines and hope that leaders will take care of things.
- Overcoming civic withdrawal requires courage. (para. 13)
  - Requires creating a renewed definition of ourselves. (e.g. nation of active stakeholders, Jefferson)
- Importance of citizens' direct participation in democracy expresed by the ancient Greeks. (para. 14)
- Reclaiming the political voice requires more jut than identifying problems. Too many issues can overload us. (para. 15)
- Depressed people are convinced that their difficulties are permanent and pervasive, linked to personal failings. (para. 16)
  - Inaction is allowed in depressed lives.
- Change is not always easy; not everyone is an equal change to bring it. (para. 17)
- Powerlessness afflicts even the fortunate among us; often they retrict their search for meaning in privacy. (para. 18)
- We can ignore problem that lie on our front doors, or wqe can shape a generous and common future.
