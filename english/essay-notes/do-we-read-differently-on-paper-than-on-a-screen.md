## Introduction
- On a global scale, we are reading like never before and spending more time glued to the screen. (para. 1)

## How much time do we spend reading on screen and what are we reading?
- This answer depends on how "reading" i defined. (para. 2)
- It is dependent on the reading of textual material, but also including pictures, social media, and hyptertext.
- We find that if the latter definition is employed, one could say that the Internet has brought about an explosion of reading.
- Digital book sales, however, have stabilized.
  - Readers often do not find reading a Kindle as inspiring a reading a paper book, however.

## When do we prefer a printed medium, such as a book?
- Many components factor into this decision. (para. 3)
- Reader's proficiency, background, and expectations; type of material, kind of screen.
- Length of text seems to be another critical factor.
  - If it is long, a physical book is preferred.
  - If it is shorter, an e-book is preferred.

## How can you explain this?
- Reading long, linear, and continuous texts requires concentration ("Deep Reading"). (para. 4)
- The reader often experiences better concentration when reading from a printed medium.
- Only one section can be een at a time whenr eading from a screen.
- On a book, several text areas are available simultaneously.

## Do we read better or worse on screens compared to printed media?
- This is dependent on our definitions of "reading" and the context.
- Our reading comprehension is decreased while we read faster on screens.
- Findings highlight that we have a different mental attitude when confronted with reading ona  screen.

## What is it with books that catches our attention?
- A book has physical attributes that suggest omething about the content and text (page. 6)
- Something to do with *seeing* and *feeling* it whiel browsing a book influences how we approach it.

## What is E-READ researching and how is the research being conducted?
- Reading literature has a stimulating effect on the imagination and can encourage empathy. (para. 7)
- Reading has an effect on our ability to concentrate.
- E-READ is a research network; studying aspects including congitive proceses, understanding, etc.
- Looking for neuropyschological and physioogical apects of reading (eye movements, etc.)

## What do you believe should be researched in more depth within the field of reading research?
- More empirical and interdisciplinary research should be done into how people read different types of texts (para. 8).
- Components, factors, and conditions need to be better understood; difference need to be mapped out.
