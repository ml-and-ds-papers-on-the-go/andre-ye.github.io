### Episodes

#### Deep Learning's Million-Dollar Question Pt. 1: Rethinking Generalization and Why We Care | Ep. 1
<p>Why don't neural networks overfit when they have so many parameters? It's deep learning's million-dollar question and one we'll try to get a few steps closer to answering.</p>
<p>We'll get an introduction to the million-dollar question, get an understanding for the surprising amount of information neural networks can carry, and explore the discussion and research around Deep Double Descent phenomena.</p>
