  Thesis: Education – its meaning, implementation, and value – has shifted significantly throughout history. Even the roots of its etymology reveal its complexity; education comes from the Latin educere, which some define as bringing or drawing out – education as finding and developing something within, centered around developing general skills – and others as training or being led forth – the cultivation of the mind with imparted knowledge, aiming for a knowledgeable population. These represent two fundamental pillars of thought on education’s purpose and scope, yet neither are complete individually. The purpose of education is to inspire and to guide its students along the empirical arts with emphasis on individuality and fostering passion, for it is both moral and practical. Education centers around student initiative, and any educational system that ignores this will find that their students stop wherever the system drops them, if not earlier. Even as a drive to learn is anchored to content, it is possible – and much more effective – to forgo advancing rapidly with content and ensure that students fully understand and appreciate what has been learned so far. A strong discovery-centric curriculum can give students of all abilities depth and interest in any subject, regardless how simple. Education, while serving society, is at its root for the individual. Passivity can do little; invigoration and fascination will always be able to overcome any knowledge deficit.

  Thesis: All-encompassing fear – not only from a fear of slaves but from every direction – natives, indentured servants, limitations to legislative action from both from within and outside the gentry – drove the development of racism and racialized chattel slavery. Towards the end of the 1700s and early 1800s, racialized chattel slavery was not driven by economics, but by fear. Building upon conflicts and ideas that stemmed from capitalism in England, the initial hostility between the elite and the working-class – specifically, the elite’s opinions on how to extract more profit from a working-class they saw as idle and lazy – was set up. However, as capitalism drove the numbers against the gentry, demonstrated by Bacon’s Rebellion, the elite chose to develop racism as a social tool out of fear of retaliation from the natives and fear from a working-class riot. When the slave population continued to amass and incidents like the Stono rebellion, the gentry attempted to regulate the slave trade with Britain but was undercut by poorer and younger members who still purchased slaves. With the fear of another slave riot and with the limitation of not being able to completely halt the slave trade, the gentry resorted to outright racial violence, more as an ideology than a coordinated effort to extract economic value from slaves. Furthermore, this transition of conflicts in slavery from being inherently capitalistic to being completely motivated by fear from a variety of sources – the natives, white indentured servants rioting and seizing control, a deadly slave insurrection, among legislative limitations both from within and from Parliament – better explains American racism’s persistence past slavery as economic practice.

  ```
  Thesis: Bartolomé de Las Casas was a Spanish friar whose writings were one of the first to expose Europe to the oppression of indigenous peoples, and John Locke was an English philosopher who articulated unique arguments for private property and against the monarchy. Both produced writings that provide a detailed understanding of the Spanish and English conquests in the Americas. The characterization of the relationship between Christianity and the Natives played an instrumental role in the Europeans’ moral justification or objection to their oppression and to conquest. The purpose religion serves in these writings – as a self-centric lens through which the moral universe is constructed, with believers at its center – reflected Spain’s and England’s ambitions to shape the world through religious superiority, a belief that hardened from defeat and reunifying victory in the histories of both countries.

  ```
  Thesis: Throughout American history, the oppressed and their oppressors have fought for inclusion or exclusion in two arenas: the legislation, in granting legal rights and recognitions, and the culture, in shifting public perception and opinion. Although neither is independent from one another, groups have targeted one primarily, which would influence the other if accomplished successfully. 1830s working-class women fought against corporations in the cultural battlefield, seeking to counter corporate propaganda and to persuade the public. In the 1840s, by positioning themselves in opposition to the emergence of Asian immigration of the 1860s, European immigrants quietly won the cultural battle and began a descent into acceptance in American society. The cultural battleground now occupied, Asian immigrants could not assimilate and hence fought almost exclusively in legislative fronts. This transition from cultural to legislative in this period of American history reveals three successive1 key themes. Firstly, “degrees of separation”, a dynamic metric of how removed an identity is from society, was complicated by different group identities participating in society. Secondly, any notable degrees of separation of one identity generally collapsed when another identity with a higher degree of separation arose. Thirdly, the successful integration of each previous group into society (via collapsing of degrees of separation) created legislative openings but closed cultural opportunities for the next group. These three concepts determined the strategy each group took in arguing for their inclusion in the United States.
