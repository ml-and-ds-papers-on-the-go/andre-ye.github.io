## Introduction
*page 2*
- Thomas W. Conway - stated his policy regarding families of southern black Union soldiers; although slaveowners had drove them off plantations in starving conditions, Conway believed in treating the black soldiers and their families to the same responsibilities as white soldiers.
  - Acknowledged the sacrifices black men had made, but believed that freed people could do well off with "a little economy and industry".
- A debate over the fate of emancipated slaves cast major white participants into new roles.
  - Neoabolitionists sought to implement ideas of moral significance.
  - "Free labor" ideology provided former slave with oppurtunity to exchange labor in a new marketplace.
- Whites feared black people's desire for family autonomy.
  - Preference of wives and mothers to take wage work instead of their own households.
  - Freedwomen were considered exempt from ideal of full-time domesticity.
- Southern plantations believed that "free black labor" was a contradiction.
  - Began a vicious cycle of prodding labor and hysteria about low agricultural productivity in the South.
- **The North and the South** differed tremendously in how they would re-build the South.
  - Did assume black wives and mothers would continue in productive labor outside their homes.
- However, freed blacks resisted northern work ethic and neoslavery.
  - Were happiest when they worked for themselves in a sharecropping sense.
  - The industrial North was increasingly becoming authoritarian in its manager-worker relations.
  - Sharecropping sytem gave innumerable benefits of freedom.
- *Emancipation was not a gift given by some presidential proclamation, but a process in which black people transfered their labor from their masters to themselves.*
  - Black people struggled between spheres of economic and social welfare, but wanted for women to be wives first and cotton pickers econd.
- Experiences of black women in these time reveals the strength and personal level of the Civil War and Reconstruction.

## In Pursuit of Freedom
*page 4*
- Slavery gradually diminished, however, freedom was opened to many but very slowly and only in a few degree.
- Women: welfare of children was often the primary consideration in determining an appropriate course of action.
- Awareness and choice often shaped the decisions of slave women during this time.
  - Some engineered dramatic escapes, some decided to remain on plantations for their children.
  - Black children were not allowed to go to school, taught only to work.
- Under the conditions in which situations produced by an absent master or nervous mistress unable to obtain an upper hand, slaves would slow their workpace: "awkward', "inefficient", "lazy".
  - This seemed to spur more fears about the role of black female slaves, often in households, that might perform some sort of sabatoge.
- Loosened by distractions of war, slaves pushed physical and emotional resolve of those in authority.
  - The war had intensified their hardships.
- Slave women took an increasing role in caring for the children, ill, and the elderly during wartime, more so than during the antebellum period.
  - Military mobilization broke fragile ties between slave families.
  - Men were put in military construction projects, armies, factories, etc. slave impressment policies.
- An approaching Union army gave laves a chance to flee from their masters.
  - Single mothers ran away from their masters and sought protection behind Union lines.

### Black Slaves and Impact on Family Structures
- Union territory symbolized the beginning of a new life, but the beginning was not entirely pleasant. Lacked food, shelter, medicine, etc.
  - Refugee settlements became targets for black male conscription.
  - However, caused resentment among the refugees; women saw the draft as a seizure or a raid.
  - Well-being of families remained a source of anxiety for them
  - Black soldiers demanded the federal government provide loved ones with some sort of protection.
- Some families followed male soldiers to the front lines; however this was discouraged.
- Payment of soldiers' wages was slow and unpredictable. Left mothers with complete responsibility for full support of children.
  - Discouraged qualified women from seeking aid in the Army Quartermaster Department.
- Employment as a cook, etc. did not come easily.

### Slaves That Stayed
- Although many women had no choice but to seek food and safety from Northern troops, some attained relative freedom where they were.
- Many whites had fled in large numbers were black men had marched.
  - Several hundred women made a small colony.
- Fleeing black women deprived the South of a large labor supply.

### Conclusion
Among the dislocation of the Civil War, a common purpose remained to escape oppression of slavery while attempting to keep family intact.

## Black Women as Free Laborers
*page 18*
- Many black women and men travelled to towns to escape masters, but many had to search for work.
  - Government failed to institute comprehensive land confiscation and redistribution; Southern whites refused to sell property or extend credit to former slaves.
  - Majority of slaves would remain economicaly dependent on the group to which they had served as salves.
- Most freed people remained concentrated in the Cotton Belt.
- Northern vision of free labor markets struck the Confederates as ludicrous.

### Northern Free Labor Thought
- There was some divergence in reconstructing southern society, but freedom was often equated with oppurtunity to work for oneself.
- Northerners conceived a contract labor system that would ensure cotton production and deincentivize exploitation.
  - Contract system premised on the idea that freed people would embrace gainful employment out of economic necessity.
- Some believed black slaves required punitive measures to refresh their souls.
- Slave women did not have much luxury in choosing which work they would do.
  - Many workers were defrauded, both monetarily and in term of the physical punishment they were promised not to be subjected to.
- Many Northerners detested southern planters but empathized with them as capitalists.
- Union officials believed that freedwomen as a group should contribute full muscle power towards the rebuilding of the region's economic system.

### Unionization of Slave Workers
- Slave women performed many jobs, be it cooking, gardening, special talents, etc.; varied and depended widely on time and difficult to guage because of geographic mobility.
- Freed people were largely dependent on whites for employment, but strikes and group labor resistance began to surface.
  - Whites began to learn an important basic lesson fo Reconstruction: **blacks' attitudes towards work depended on the extent of their freedom from white supervision.**
- Blacks challenged intentions of bureau agents and northqern/southern planters alike; both underestimated the power of the workers.

### Conclusion
In making decisions about how family labor was organized, black people rejected materialistic individualism of the North as well as brutal authoritarianism of the South.

## The Political Economy of Black Family and Community Life in the Postwar Period
- Northerners that hoped black workers would pursue interests as *individuals* did not take into account strong family ties.
  - Family bound black households together.
- Black women constituted a sizable proportion fo the labor force, but their obligation to family took priority.
- Freedom, thus has little to do with individual oppurtunity but instead int he context of family.
- Institution of slavery posed a threat to the stability of family, and after emancipation family relationships solidifed.
- Black labor correspondingly dropped significantly after emancipation.

### Withdrawal of Black Females from Wage Labor
- Major theme in Reconstruction: **widthdrawal of black females from wage-labor**.
- Northernors ridiculed "lazy" freedwomen for working within their own homes.
- Many assumed freed people were engaged in an attempt to imitate white middle-class norms. However, reorganization of female labor resulted from choices by men and women.
  - Women were to be protected by freedmen from rape by eliminating white man-black woman interaction.
- Slavery's persistence continued in the minds of black women that continued to suffer abuse from white employers.
- Blacks preferred to organize by kin group, or "squad" system.
  - Non-bureaucratic, self-regulating, self-selecting worker peer group.
- Tug of economic and pyschological warfare between planters cultiminated in the "compromise" - the **sharecropping system.**

### Sharecroppping System
- Met demands of each party; a relatively reliable source of labor and a measure of independence.
- Sharecroppers moved into small houses around a plantation; contracts were renegotiated every year.
- This system reshaped Southern race and class relations. 
- Most freedwomen lived in rural areas, were illiterate, and very poor.
  - Fertility rates went down very lowly; women were severely circumscribed.
  - Most children did not have a chance to go to school.
  - Black women were distinguished primarily by lower socioeconomic status and reliance on families of work done outside the realm of traditional domestic responsbilities.

### Sexual Division of Labor
- The husband represented the family; men exercised authoritiy by age and sex.
- Freedmen's Bureau's wage guidelines mandated black women and men recieve unequal compensation; bureau held men responsible for wives' unwillingness to labor.
- This division of labor became more sharp after emancipation.
  - Domestic duties were seen to be a woman's major obligation; contrast with slavemaster's view of female as a field or hosue worker.
- Women's agricultural labor was more seasonal than that of their husbands; they worked when there labor was needed.
- One cannot separate freedwomen's "work" from family-based obligations; productive labor had no meaning outside of family.
- Husbands and wives needed each other to form a complete economic unit.
  - If necessary, the wife would step into the husband's "sphere" or work.
- The interests of the family superceded individual desires.
- Obligations of black women assumed greater significance than immigrant or poor white communities because of distinctive low economic status possessed by blacks.

### Kinship and Collectivization of Labor
- Field workers and nonworkers managed to care for themselves by growing vegetables, catching fish, trapping game, etc.
  - Relied consequently less on wages paid by their employer.
- There was a belief that black workers were *burdened* by their relatives.

### Political Gathering of Freedmen
- Vitality of the political process provided back men a public forum distinct from the private sphere inhabited by woemn.
  - Black men believed males alone were responsible for the serious business of politicking.
- Freedmen monopolized formal positions of power within their own communities; however, freedwomen did not simply accept them all. Often these worlds clashed.
- Freed people had a preference to work in "traditional" rural society rather than a nationalistic goal of social or economic progress.
- Black households conformed to the "premodern" family model; however, the terms are a bit misleading becuase sharecropping families actually represented an adaptation.

### Conclusion
The development of a coexisting between economic and social family worlds was significant and made a living increasingly carried by individuals apart from family life.

## New Dresses, Defiant Words, and Their Price
- Significance of clothing in an era whenr ace relations were at least temporarily fluctuating.
- Role of women's clothes in transition from slavery to freedomw as significant.
  - Older forms of dress were scorned in favor of more colorful and elaborate garments.
- Black husbands took pride in buying fashinoable dresses for their women.
- Clothing signaled a struggle over "social equality"; freedwomen were more outspoken and aggressive in their willingnes to confront white authority figures.
- Freedwomen were especially impressed by the challenge to womanhood that subverted female submissiveness.
  - Almost ironically, this put freedmen into a position of being more "reasonable".
- Black women paid for their assertiveness by acting like free women.
  - Continued to toil as they had under slavery and remained susceptible to punishment for offenses by angry overseers, often over compensation disagreements.
  - Violence was not only sanctioned by sometimes *initiated* by 'law-enforcement'.
- Systematic legal corruption made it difficult for black women to get justice for their assault.
- **These were personal attacks carried out face-to-face.**

### Conclusion
Patterns of interracial violence revealed anxieties related to sex, race, and power that remained locked in the South's collective consciousness.

## Out of the Fields: City Life and Schooling
*page 31*
- Only 1/10 blacks lived in towns with populations > 2,5000 in 1870.
  - However, experiences of urban freedwomen are important to consider.
- Black men, women,a nd children came to the city; fleeing the war-torn countryside to seek food and safety but seen by many whites as an escape to luxury and apathy.
- Hostility among whites caused a black exodus from the cotton fields; women were overrepresented among free people that remained in the cities permanently after the war.
- Black women ecured jobs in a limited number of occupations at the bottom of the wage scale, like "women's work" or as industrial laborers.
- Three times as many black women to white women listed an occupation.
- Quality of city life had little to offer to mot freed people; encountered resentment of white competitors and racism fo white customers.
- Economic and political conditions crushed health, stability, and welfare of the urban black family.
  - Meanwhile, it gave rich culutral, educational, and religious oppurtunities.
  - Social structure in urban areas was more complex.
  - City children were able to attend class, variety of educational institutions concentrated.
- Black women sponsored and supported social events, reinforced black community solidarity.
  - Working women found it less difficult to band together and stage collective job actions.
- Social consequences of freedom accompanied by changes in the way women worked, dressed, and thought about themsevles.
- Liberation from bondage brought tangible, immediate benefits to some women.
- For most women, childbearing and rearing, household chores and employment, etc. representing a continuum from slavery to freedom.

### Conclusion
Black women continued to occupy two statuses: as wives, mothers, and upholders of culture in their neighborhoods, and as workers belonging to a despised caste. Freedwomen percieved freedom not to be a release from labor, but the oppurtunity labor for their own families and community.
