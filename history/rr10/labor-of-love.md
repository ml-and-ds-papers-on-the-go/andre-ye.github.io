## Introduction
*page 2*
- Thomas W. Conway - stated his policy regarding families of southern black Union soldiers; although slaveowners had drove them off plantations in starving conditions, Conway believed in treating the black soldiers and their families to the same responsibilities as white soldiers.
  - Acknowledged the sacrifices black men had made, but believed that freed people could do well off with "a little economy and industry".
- A debate over the fate of emancipated slaves cast major white participants into new roles.
  - Neoabolitionists sought to implement ideas of moral significance.
  - "Free labor" ideology provided former slave with oppurtunity to exchange labor in a new marketplace.
- Whites feared black people's desire for family autonomy.
  - Preference of wives and mothers to take wage work instead of their own households.
  - Freedwomen were considered exempt from ideal of full-time domesticity.
- Southern plantations believed that "free black labor" was a contradiction.
  - Began a vicious cycle of prodding labor and hysteria about low agricultural productivity in the South.
- **The North and the South** differed tremendously in how they would re-build the South.
  - Did assume black wives and mothers would continue in productive labor outside their homes.
- However, freed blacks resisted northern work ethic and neoslavery.
  - Were happiest when they worked for themselves in a sharecropping sense.
  - The industrial North was increasingly becoming authoritarian in its manager-worker relations.
  - Sharecropping sytem gave innumerable benefits of freedom.
- *Emancipation was not a gift given by some presidential proclamation, but a process in which black people transfered their labor from their masters to themselves.*
  - Black people struggled between spheres of economic and social welfare, but wanted for women to be wives first and cotton pickers econd.
- Experiences of black women in these time reveals the strength and personal level of the Civil War and Reconstruction.

## In Pursuit of Freedom
*page 4*
- Slavery gradually diminished, however, freedom was opened to many but very slowly and only in a few degree.
- Women: welfare of children was often the primary consideration in determining an appropriate course of action.
- Awareness and choice often shaped the decisions of slave women during this time.
  - Some engineered dramatic escapes, some decided to remain on plantations for their children.
  - Black children were not allowed to go to school, taught only to work.
- Under the conditions in which situations produced by an absent master or nervous mistress unable to obtain an upper hand, slaves would slow their workpace: "awkward', "inefficient", "lazy".
  - This seemed to spur more fears about the role of black female slaves, often in households, that might perform some sort of sabatoge.
- Loosened by distractions of war, slaves pushed physical and emotional resolve of those in authority.
  - The war had intensified their hardships.
- Slave women took an increasing role in caring for the children, ill, and the elderly during wartime, more so than during the antebellum period.
  - Military mobilization broke fragile ties between slave families.
  - Men were put in military construction projects, armies, factories, etc. slave impressment policies.
- An approaching Union army gave laves a chance to flee from their masters.
  - Single mothers ran away from their masters and sought protection behind Union lines.

### Black Slaves and Impact on Family Structures
- Union territory symbolized the beginning of a new life, but the beginning was not entirely pleasant. Lacked food, shelter, medicine, etc.
  - Refugee settlements became targets for black male conscription.
  - However, caused resentment among the refugees; women saw the draft as a seizure or a raid.
  - Well-being of families remained a source of anxiety for them
  - Black soldiers demanded the federal government provide loved ones with some sort of protection.
- Some families followed male soldiers to the front lines; however this was discouraged.
- Payment of soldiers' wages was slow and unpredictable. Left mothers with complete responsibility for full support of children.
  - Discouraged qualified women from seeking aid in the Army Quartermaster Department.
- Employment as a cook, etc. did not come easily.

### Slaves That Stayed
- Although many women had no choice but to seek food and safety from Northern troops, some attained relative freedom where they were.
- Many whites had fled in large numbers were black men had marched.
  - Several hundred women made a small colony.
- Fleeing black women deprived the South of a large labor supply.

### Conclusion
Among the dislocation of the Civil War, a common purpose remained to escape oppression of slavery while attempting to keep familie intact.

## Black Women as Free Laborers
*page 18*
- Many black women and men travelled to towns to escape masters, but many had to search for work.
  - Government failed to institute comprehensive land confiscation and redistribution; Southern whites refused to sell property or extend credit to former slaves.
  - Majority of slaves would remain economicaly dependent on the group to which they had served as salves.
- Most freed people remained concentrated in the Cotton Belt.
- Northern vision of free labor markets struck the Confederates as ludicrous.

### Northern Free Labor Thought
- There was some divergence in reconstructing southern society, but freedom was often equated with oppurtunity to work for oneself.
- Northerners conceived a contract labor system that would ensure cotton production and deincentivize exploitation.
  - Contract system premised on the idea that freed people would embrace gainful employment out of economic necessity.
- Some believed black slaves required punitive measures to refresh their souls.
- Slave women did not have much luxury in choosing which work they would do.
  - Many workers were defrauded, both monetarily and in term of the physical punishment they were promised not to be subjected to.
- Many Northerners detested southern planters but empathized with them as capitalists.
- Union officials believed that freedwomen as a group should contribute full muscle power towards the rebuilding of the region's economic system.

### Unionization of Slave Workers
- Slave women performed many jobs, be it cooking, gardening, special talents, etc.; varied and depended widely on time and difficult to guage because of geographic mobility.
- Freed people were largely dependent on whites for employment, but strikes and group labor resistance began to surface.
  - Whites began to learn an important basic lesson fo Reconstruction: **blacks' attitudes towards work depended on the extent of their freedom from white supervision.**
- Blacks challenged intentions of bureau agents and northqern/southern planters alike; both underestimated the power of the workers.

### Conclusion
In making decisions about how family labor was organized, black people rejected materialistic individualism of the North as well as brutal authoritarianism of the South.
