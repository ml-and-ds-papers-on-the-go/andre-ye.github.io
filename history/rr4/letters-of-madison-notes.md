### Notes


- Key Points
  - Important question: _what purpose can a bill of rights serve in a republic ("popular government")?_
  - James Madison is largely conflicted in the debate between whether to include a bill of rights or not. He does not see clear indications for its inclusion or exclusion, although he leans towards its exclusion.
  - Main themes: the danger of democracies & mob rule, the circularity in danger of liberty, comparisons between power dynamics of monarchies and republics.

<br>

| Government | Political Power | Physical Power | Purpose of Bill of Rights |
| :---: | :-----: | :-----: | :----- |
| Monarchy | In the few [^10] | In the many [^11] | To unite the people, who have the physical power, to rebel against infringements on rights of the people by the few. |
| Republic "Popular" | In the many [^12] | In the many [^12] | Not much purpose; the majority can infringe upon rights of the minority without political or physical repercussions. |


[^10]: (in the monarch.)
[^11]: (in the people.)
[^12]: (in the majority.)

<br>

- Controversial proposal in adding a Bill of Rights.
  - Opinion groups:
    - Some want for *further guards of public liberty and individual rights*.
    - Some believe such an addition was not necessary (i.e. it already existed).
    - Some believe such articles were not to be in the Constitution at all.

<br><br>

- **James Madison's Opinion** on the Bill of Rights
  > My [*James Madison*] own opinion has been in favor of a bill of rights; provided it be so framed as not to imply powers not meant to be included in the enumeration. At the same time I have never thought the ommission a material defect, nor been anxious to supply it even by subsequent amendment, for any other reason than that it is anxiously desired by others.[^1]
  - Paraphrase: James Madison is in favor of a bill of rights given that it does not list too many individual powers; he is also fine with its exclusion (not a 'material defect'). Largely neutral in opinion, although later he will provides reasoning against inclusion of a bill of rights.
  - *Believed the Bill of Rights could be of use and "of no disservice" if executed properly*.

<br><br>

- **Issues with the Bill of Rights**/Points of Doubt James Madison writes:
  - There is reason to fear this declaration of individual rights would not be obtained with the lateral support necessary.
    - Rights that are broadly declared will likely be narrowed down in interpretation anyway.
    > "One of the objections in New England was that the Constitution by prohibiting religious tests open a door for Jews Turks and infidels." [^2]
  - The limited powers of the federal government gives the states, ultimately, the most power. This "security", in Madison's language, must be maintained.
  - A declaration of bill of rights causes problems when the government needs control.

<br><br>

- **The Danger of Pure Democracies**
  > "In Virginia I have seen the bill of rights violated in every instance where it has been opposed to a popular current."[^3]
  - Even if an "*explicit provision contained in that instrument for the rights of Conscience*"[^4] were to exist, majorities often 'override' them.
    > "Wherever the real power in a Government lies, there is danger of oppression."[^5]
  - *Often, majorities in the community infringe upon the private rights of the minorities, only because in these cases the government is simply a tool of the majority.*
    - Madison writes that this truth has not been "sufficiently attended to."

<br><br>

- **Comparisons in Power Dynamics of Monarchies and Republics**
  - Republics are superior to monarchies because there is a lesser probability or impact of abuses of power.
    - In Monarchies, power can be exerted from one person to the majority.
    - In Republics, power can be exerted from a majority to a minority.
  - Differences in political and physical power.
    - In Monarchies, the political power is in the hands of a few but the physical power is in the majority. Rebellion, riot, and revolution likely arise.
    - In Republics, the political and physical power are both in the hands of the majority.

<br><br>

- **The Purpose of a Bill of Rights in Monarchies and Republics**
  - What use can a bill of rights serve in popular governments if the majority control both the political and physical power?
  - Two answers Madison provides:
    - When these political truths (i.e. declarations of individual rights) are formally declared and become embedded in national sentiment, they "counteract the impulses of interest and passion."[^6]
    - Sometimes, infringements of power may also come from unpopular and unjust rulers; a bill of rights will be valuable just as it would be in uniting community in a monarchy.[^7]

<br><br>

- **Liberty is a circular, not linear, in danger.**
  - Too much and too little of it is dangerous.
  > "It is a melancholy reflection that liberty should be equally exposed to danger whether the Government have too much or too little power".[^8]
  - The line that divides too much and too litle power is "inaccurately defined by experience."

<br><br>

- **Madison's Concluding Statements**
  - *Absolute declarations of rights should be avoided*, in doubtful or emergency cases.
  - Certain rights, regardless how strong, will never be followed if the majority of the public opposes them, and completely lose their value after repeated violation.
    - The best security against the majority rule is to remove their fuel altogether.
  - Regardless, *there is infinitely less danger of abuse in a republic than in a monarchy.*
    - When power is in the hands of the few, it is natural to abuse it.
    - When power is in the hands of the many, danger is much lesser.
  > "It is much more to be dreaded that the few will be unnecessarily sacrificed to the many."[^9]
