## Notes on Section 1: Introduction

### Main Ideas
- Nonelites powerfully influenced Revolutionary politics.
  - Virginian gentlemen's struggle to extend freedom were aided by other freedom struggles.
  - The gentry that made the declaration of independence were very interested in the actions of natives, slaves, and smallholders.
- The image of confident colonial elite pushing for freedom is lacking and excludes other groups.

### Opening Ideas
- Americans like to imagine the colonial elite - Thomas Jefferson & George Washington, to name two - as proud and optimistic leaders; instead, their desperation drove them to the American Revolution.
- Consider **Jacob Hite**, who in April 1774 took desperate measures like: (p2)
  - Crashing down the gates of prisons
  - Placing weapons in the hands of slaves
  - Was one of the wealthiest men in Berkely County, Virginia

### Example: Jacob Hite

- Hite was the son of a successful land speculator.
- 1760s scheme to gain land from Cherokee Indians
  - Business partner (Richard Pearis) had a half-Cherokee son (George)
  - George asked Cherokees for 150,000-acre land
  - Sold the land to Richard Pearis and Jacob Hite
- Failure of deal
  - British officials feared it may provoke Cherokees to join an anti-British confederation; South Carolina court voided the deal.
  - Left Hite in debt, had property to be auctioned to pay it off.
  - Fall 1773 - price of tobacco sunk to lowest levels ever.
  - Sheriff siezed Hite's slaves and horses to jail (Apr. 12, 1774)
- Reclamation of property
  - Thomas Hite (son) and his gang surrounded the jail and siezed the salves & horses
  - The slaves would suffer if Sherriff recaptured them [^2]; Hite used this to convince and arm slaves against the Sherrif.
- **Debt was a powerful reason to protest Parliament.**
  - Sherriff feared jury would side with Hite:
  > "...it being too general a wish among the people to evade the payment of their Debts and render the authority of [court] Judgements... of none effect."[^3]
  - Virginia courts refused to try suits brought by creditors [^4] against debtors [^5]
    - Temporarily closed to protest Parliament's assault on "American liberty" and to prevent creditors from taking property and freedom from debtors.

### Hite's story as proof against a faulty historical record
- Surely Hite's story of desperation must not apply to other American figures; Patrick Henry, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson.
- Opposition historical viewpoint:
  - Washington and Jefferson were confident and successful, continuing westward expansion was inevitable given:
    - Slave ownership
    - A solid relationship with British merchants
    - Exercising "almost unchallenged hegemony" over other classes in the province
  - The key to Virginia gentlemen's secure position was a good relationship with small farmers, then
    - Surrounded by farmers, tenants, artisans, sailors
    - Historians question the assertion of gentry [^6] confidence
- It was not that the gentry [^6] 'pulled the strings' of other groups [^7]; each group had leverage but, in complex and perhaps unintentional ways, helped push the gentry towards rebellion. (pg. 4)

### Definitions
What defines the 'gentry'?
- Owned money, slaves, and land.
- Sat on the House of Burgesses, Executive Council, benches of county courts.
- Fought for capital, labor, and land in each group
  - British merchants over capital
  - Agricultural workers over labor
  - Natives over their land
  

*merchant*
: mercantile firms and transatlantic slave traders in Glasgow, London, and other British ports.

*storekeepers* or *factors*
: employees of merchants located in the Chesapeake.

*traders*
: independent Virginia entrepreneurs.

### Ways gentry-group interactions shapes independence
- British-gentry-slave relationships
  - Enslaved population grew from 9% to 40% by 1775 [^8]; good news for slaveowners and allowed House of Burgesses to stop importation of slaves [^9].
  - British merchants persuaded Britain's executive body to veto Virginian taxes on every imported African slave.
  - Threat of new slaves + financial damage by London government = support for political independence.
- Late 1774, enslaved Virginians, who hoped to become free, furthered patriotic centiment and aided white Virginians.
- Nonexportation provisions of Continental association deprived smallholders of their export income.
  - Contributed to gentry's decision to make formal declaration of independence.

## Notes on Section 2: Tobacco Growers Versus Merchants and Parliament (pg. 7)

### Main Ideas
- Many conflicts between tobacco growers and merchants & Parliament spurred the want for independence.
- The Navigation Acts and limitations on trade drastically cut tobacco grower's profits; the price of tobacco fell at least 75%.
- Tobacco Growers and other poorer Virginians increasingly had conflicts with British creditors who came to collect debt, often by taking a large portion of the debtor's property.
- By forcing the Atlantic Slave Trade, Britain economically hurt and destabilized Virginia.
- Taxation without representation was characterized as slavery. Britain has already monopolized Virginia's trade, so they had no right to tax them as well. Even slaves (actual slaves) had the right to own their own money during Sundays and evenings.

### Opening Ideas
- Robert Routledge, Tuesday, June 3rd, 1766.
  - Lived in Virginia and sold freign merchandise to tobacco farmers.
  - Celebrating Parliament's repeal of the Stamp Act (Virginia courts closed and refused to hear cases)
  - Courthouses would now reopen and Routledge could resume action against debtors.
- John Chiswell
  - In thousands of pounds of debt
  - Son-in-law (John Robinson) died, lent Chiswell money; courts would demand funds be repaid.
- Conflicting attitudes about the reopening of courts and got in an argument at the tavern.
  - Chiswell killed Routledge by sword, then later committed suicide.
- Conflict between creditors and debtors (growsers and merchants).
  
### On Debt
- Many conflict revolved around debt.
  - Routledge and Chiswell (see above).
  - Jacob Hite's debt drove him to attack the county jail and arm his slaves agains tthe Sherriff.
  - Thomas Swetnam fell so deep in debt his property was exhausted and his children were sold.
- Debt destroyed lives and families, *but also personal independence*.
  - People that loathed debt feel deeper in it.

### Explanations of Debt
- Wealthy debtors and gentlemen attributed financial difficulties to the cutting out of middlemen dues.
  - Money problems blamed on personal extravagance.
- Convinced British merchants persuaded Parliament to adopt policies that favored their interest and the expense of Virginians.

### Mercantilism as Slavery (pg. 11)
- In 1760s and 1770s, American pamphleteers often compared British taxations with consent as enslavement.
  - Becoming "the slaves of Britain"
- Virginia slaveholders could not take away slaves' rights to earn money for themselves on evenings and Sundays.
  - The British Parliament, while taking away much, still allowed "us the little we have been permitted to earn for ourselves"[^10].
- Argument: *Britain, which has monopolized Virginia's trade, has no right to tax them as well.*

### The Argument Against Taxation (pg. 11)
- Taxation as slavery may have been one of the reasons why colonists objected so much to parliamentary taxes that would seem less than in England, Wales, and Scotland.
- Justifications:
  - *Constitutional*. Parliament has no right to taxation because colonists were not represented in it.
  - *Practical*. A master that has already control of his slaves' labor cannot do the same with evening hours.
    - e.g. colonists have already submitted to Navigation Acts. They have shared their wealth to Britain enough.
    
### The Navigation Act & Limitations on Trade (pg. 12)
- Navigation act: dictates that goods could only be exported from the colonies to England on British forces.
- Exluded Dutch merchantmen from the Chesapeake trade; price of tobacco fell 75%.
- Additional Navigation Act - prohibited shipment of foreign goods to American colonies except through British ports.
- Navigation Acts and fall in tobacco market blamed for social unrest (Bacon's Rebellion 1676 and 1682 plant-cutting riots especially).
- Petitions and criticisms were censured and ignored.
  - This spurred a growing demand for independence from Britain.
- Limited trade only with Britain tied up Virginians.
> Only by making trade free could Virginia render it profitable. -Richard Henry Lee
- Navigation acts blamed for tobacco grower debts and Virginia's trade deficit. [^11]
  - Arthur Lee argued half of Virginia's trade deficit was the result of the Navigation Acts.

<br>

- 100% of Chespeake tobacco was shipped to Britain.
- 15% of tobacco was consumed in Britain, the remaining being exported to the European continent.
- The sale profiteer was the British merchant, not the Chesapeake tobacco grower.
- British mercantilism was seen as a "heavy tax upon the colonies" itself.
  - Why make 'double contributions' with parliamentary taxation?
- The Americas gave England raw materials, Britain gave the American colonies manufactured goods.

<br>

- Rationale for British taxation
  - Seven Years' War doubled its debt from 72m to 123m.
  - Army officers returning from America told stories of fabulous wealth; British politicans enacted
    - Stamp Act (1765)
    - Townshend Duties (1767)
      - 1769 newspaper writer: "a gift to glind your eyes, whilst they continue to clog your trade."
    - The Navigation Acts
      - Colonial trade helped expand 'British greatness'.
      - 1/3 of Britain's overseas trade was with the American colonies.
      - Navigation Acts as the great guardian of British Commerce (Lord George Townshend)
      
### Soft Virginian Rhetoric Towards Mercantilism (pg. 15)
 
- Rhetoric against the Navigation Acts in Virginia was strong
- Did not advocate *completely* against a mercantilist system dismantling for reasons mentioned above; economically the British relied on mercantilism to survive.
- Denouncing mercantilism openly would
  - "unite every man in Britain against us." -Richard Henry Lee
  - Turn away powerful British merchants, from which many of the Virginian elite relied upon
- By the end of 1774, most Virginians chose not to demand Parliament to lift restrictions on trade and manufacturing.

### The Attack on Manufacturing (pg. 16)
- Britain wished to maintain a monopoly on manufacturing.
- Prohibited Americans from making iron and selling hats or woolen cloth outside of their home, shipping utensils in cotton and linen manufactures, among other manufacturing taxations.
- George Washington [^12] resisted the Townshend duties on manufactured goods to avoid dangerous precedent.

### Increasing Virginian Anti Navigation Acts Rhetoric (pg. 17)
- In summer of 1774, Parliament insisted colonists follow Navigation Acts and new taxes; free Virginians refused to for either.
- Thomas Jefferson: *a natural right to a free trade with all parts of the world*.
  - British merchants ripped the Americans off via free trade and the limited trade of the American colonies.
- Jefferson & Thomas Mason advocated for declarations against the Navigation Acts.
- Most leading Virginians became willing to demand the repeal of the Navigation Acts.

<br>

- After Lexington and Concrd, Virginians lost faith in British merchants persuading Parliament
  - Thus, they spoke openly against the Navigation Acts without fear of offending British businessmen.
- Free trade became one of the most important centerpieces in advocating for independence.
- By pitting Virginia tobacco growers against the British merchants, a class conflict in favor of independence emerged.

### Creditor-Debtor Conflicts (pg. 18)
- Both Virginia tobacco growers and British merchants clashed in creditor-debtor legislation.
- Desperate debtors could become violent, and debt collectors often carried defensive weapons. Imprisoned debtors would burn down jails and attempt to recapture their property.
  - This alarmed the gentry, who believed they could only keep black slaves in check if the white population was completely unified.
- House of Burgesses tried to legislatively protect debtors from British creditors.

<br>

- Virginia financed Seven Years' War by printing paper money; value depreciated in relation to pound sterling but did not require Virginia debtors to pay British debts in sterling.
- **Currency Act of 1764** prohibited provincial legislatures from issuing legal tender-paper money which creditors would be legally required to accept in discharge of debts.
- Loan office proposals were thwarted by government officials who did not want to offend British merchants by approving any money.
  - Virginians expected the loan office to pull them out of financial crisis.
- A money shortage meant that debtors often had to pay with property and not money.
  - Debtors often paid double what they owed.
  
### Forced Immigration of Africans and West Indians into Virginia (pg. 21)
- Another grower-merchant conflict was the forced immigration of Africans and West Indians into Virginia.
- Thomas Jefferson *opposed African immigration*.
  - Jefferson denounced the slave trade in his draft of the Declaration of Independence because it hurt him personally.
    - Inherited debt from the slave trade.
- April 1772 - Jefferson and every member of the House of Burgesses voted to ask George III to abolish the Atlantic slave trade.

<br>

- 1767-1796, House of Burgesses voted to double the duty of slaves arriving in Virginia from 10 to 20%.
  - Goal: to curb further slaves, not to increase revenue.
- Motives:
  - Curb the growth in number of Virginia laborers to increase tobacco price.
  - Increase the amont of cash in free Virginian hands to address hte money shortage.
  - Virginian slave sellers wanted to eliminate competition.
  - Remove tobacco growers financing slaves by going further into debt.

<br>

- Leading Virginians believed *cutting back slave imports woudl stabalize Virginia*.
  - Slavery required so much capital that other areas like manufacturing projects were neglected.
  - Slavery degraded the value of manual labor.
  - Reduce the chance of slave insurrection plots.
> "Perhaps the primary Cause of the Destruction on the most flourishing Government that ever existed [Rome's] was the Introduction of great Numbers of Slaves." -George Mason, 1765.

<br>

- Many richer and older gentlemen had stopped purchasing foreign slaves. 
  - Since they produced slaves through existing slaves having children, they had a monopoly on slaves.
- Less wealthy and younger southern piedmont growers who wanted slaves pressured HoB [^13] into reducing the duty from 30% to 10%.
- Regardless, the HoB tried to limit the trade by doubling the duty and petitioning the Privy Council to end it altogether [^14].

<br>

- After rejection, this was blamed on the British slave shippers.
- Only through independence, could Virginia ignore slave merchants and stop the Atlantic African slave trade.
- Conflict between Virginia's gentry class and Britain's mercantile class.

## Notes on Section 6: Gentlemen vs. Farmers (pg. 25)

### Main Ideas
- The American Revolution is remembered as a confident step - it was actually an act of desperation.
- Independent companies [^15] were favored by the poor farmers for their democratic structure; efforts at militia reform and the creation of a minuteman battalion failed and were met with opposition.
  - The reformation, intended to provide structure to militias and quell unrest, provoked more of it.
- Salt riots formed when the New England Restraining Act took effect as a result of lack of resources; open trade and independence was the prescribed solution.
- Conflicts between renters and tenants broke out, especially in Loudoun.
  - Tenants, suffering under closed export markets, could not pay rent.
  - Paper money was depreciating in value, yet employers paid tenants in paper money.
  - Renters, who were aware of depreciating paper money, demanded other more constant forms of payment.
  - Tenants formed rent strikes and refused to pay. They were often evicted and had their property siezed.
- Military policies were controversial.
  - The discrepancy between officers' and common soldiers' wages were high.
  - The war continued on for too long.
- Virginia and other rebel provinces needed to contact a commercial alliance [^16] to solve these problems.
  - One could only do so with Independence.
- A formal government could better deal with uprising and civilian/military disorder.
  - The fear of disorder was a powerful tool for Independence.
