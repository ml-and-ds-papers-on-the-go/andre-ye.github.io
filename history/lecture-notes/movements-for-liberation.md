## Introduction
- Framework for thinking about what those in a political position to struggle against slavery were up against.
  - Who had the interest to undo the slave system?
  - Most people adopted some form of the argument - "It's natural", "been with society", "doesn't impact me", etc.
- Am I Not a Man and a Brother? British Anti-Slavery Society, 1785.
  - Depicts a slave pleading or praying, chained to himself, caption "Am I Not a Man and a Brother?"
  - Physical body - appears as if there are lash wounds; a person who is in torment and in pain.
  - It is significant that he is on his knees.
  - Who is the actor to free the slaves? - free white people of the North.
  - Question of agency and the relationship of power - could slaves themselves? ideas of self-emancipation. Use of language between man and brother: positioned for someone to take off the chains.
  - What is the claim for freedom and liberty?
  - A claim of equality; does not say human but says man.
  - Appeal and claim to masculinity.

## Central Claims
Movements for Liberation: Slaves, Women, and Workers
- Central Questions:
  - What did liberation mean to different segments of American society?
  - How did enslaved peoples, women, and workers veiw freedom? Why?
  - How does ideology operate in society? How do ideas spread and what impact do they have?
  - What agency do the dispossessed have? When is violence justified?
- Abolition and feminism in the 19th century
  - Abolition and slave agency
  - Abolition and women
- The Women's movement
  - Abolitionist women
  - Working women
  - Seneca Falls
- Workers' Liberation
  - Debated with the abolitionist movement
- Class and Disjuncture
  - Civil War and Emancipation
  - Black Agency in the war
  - The Negro's Hour
- Key ideas:
  - Looking at the workers' and women's movement.
  - Thinking about how these different pushes begin to form a political crisis that ultimately resolves in the Civil War.

## America as a Slave Society
- Slavery is not just a part but a definitional foundation touching practically everything in American society.
- Difficult to get over the relationship of slavery with the economy; culture, status, politics, etc. tied to the institution of slavery.

### Life Under Slavery
- Depictions coming from slavemasters were inaccurate; looking at the economics we see that violence is rooted inside the system.
  - The "Happy Slave" is difficult to rectify and justify with other pictures.
  - This level of violence is not even given the capricious nature of white supremacy and racism.
  - There is a lot of rage, anger, and anti-black hostilities.
  - Immediate economic justifications: violence could be inflicted at any moment.
- Things that are obstensibly not violent, but *are*: e.g. the sale of a child.
  - A whole hierarchy of violence worked into the system.
  - Slave system is being undone; Northenors are becoming from involved into what slavery looks like.

### Maintaining Order and Slave Culture
- Based on the capricious system.
- Movements for liberation and some autonomy.
- Degrees of independence and power; also power coming from enslaved peoples.
  - Slavery was a totalizing system, but did not mean that *every hour* was pure terror.
  - There was some negotiation.
- Around things that cannot be legislated or controlled: the development of *culture*.
  - Cultural practices, values, and systems of belief cannot be legislated and regulated.
  - It is difficult, if not impossible, to do so.
  - Slave autonomy - established a space of control for themselves.
- An entire series of interesting and *syncretic* belief systems.
  - Syncretic rituals; melding original ideas with new ideas.
  - Americas: the banjo is a syncratic tradition by taking west African gourd instruments (like a squash gourd) and adapting it to the western tin drum.
    - Merges the European snare drums and African strings in a new use.
  - Mixing religious beliefs, wedding practice.
    - Demonstrates a wedding tradition - stick used to dance with comes from a West African tradition of celebrating a new life together by jumping over a branch.
    - Americas - became jumping over a broom, entering a new phase, etc.
    - Example of a syncretic tradition.
    - Blending of types of instruments.
- Used as a powerful site for resistance and teaching lessons.
  - Lessons of brier rabbit and fox fables.
    - Tradition of cunning, not wishing the worst.
    - Anger and hatred gets both in trouble.
  - Stories of slave practice are just part of the culture and autonomous development of culture.
  - Culture of resistance, survival, intelligence.
    - Values intellect and cunning, not letting emotions get the better of you.

### Threat of Sale
- Degree of power and agency.
- Sale is unidirectional; the agency and intellect.
  - Feigned illness, etc. to get themselves *returned*; a degree of slave agency.
- A violent and totalizing system, but there was a degree of influence in those circumstances.

### Slave Religion
- Enslaved persons cultural practice; slave religion.
- Like slavemasters that emphasized the Curse of Ham, were told the story of Exodus.
  - Moses leads to the enslaved Jews to the promised lands.
- Slaves are highlighting different aspect of Christian practice.
  - Hard not to see those practices as forms of resistance; political and social connotations.
- Image: enslaved person preaching to a congregation, but the master and his family are there as well.

#### Gospel of Freedom
- Emphasizes the liberatory and humane practices not only in Exodus but in Jesus' teachings in the New Testament.
- Testaments to human freedom and Emancipation.
- Foundations of Christ's teachings around the poor and the righteous to be rectified.
- A resonant idea in Christianity; part of the reason why it spread to quickly in the Roman underclass and the slave tradition.
  - Perhaps as support, but resistance present.

## Slave Resistance
- Embedded in the culture; in actual actions. Not only beliefs and talkings.
- People resisted the slave system, sometimes a day-to-day resistance that could be acts of sabatoge.
  - e.g. acts of hoeing a field; given the tools to do that, wouldn't you break the hoes.
  - Stealing food to help someone who was sick.
  - Dissembling or feigning ignorance, sets of day-to-day resistance that were worked into the system.
  - Arguments of laziness part of what is coming into play.
- Overt actions: running away became increasingly violent. 
  - A major part of resistance mainly done by men.
  - Few women ran away. (Why was this?)

### Smaller Scale Resistance
- Individual acts of resistance.
+ Overt forms of resistance; day-to-day and individualized practices of slave resistance.
+ Shirking work; not being told what to do.
+ Sabatoging/lying/feigning ignorance.
+ Seen in ledger books; (Morgan’s argument – slave resistance read as laziness)
	+ Overt: running away, an increasing crisis in American society of the 1840s.
	+ Thousands of people were running away at significant damage to slave owners (collateral of access to loans, etc.).
	+ A significant cost.
	+ Slaves running away are becoming an increasing political problem nationally.
	+ Trying to assert their form of autonomy; an individual form of resistance.
	+ Steal away to get yourself out of the situation; more riskily as a group (easier to track, only as fast as the slowest numbers, etc.)

- Significant slave uprisings in the systems.
+ Major themes: slave agency, *who has the power and interest to end the institution of slavery?*
	+ Depiction: asking to be liberated by others, is not taking action on their own behalf to make that liberation possible.
	+ Truth, Jabobs, etc. are at the center of their activity that generates broader movements in the mid nineteenth century.
+ Really began to have a destabilizing and conflictual role in American society, lead to the civil war.
	+ Modern slavery intensified under markets and profitability
	+ Focusing not on the system but slave culture.
	+ Multiple forms of resistance; syncratic traditions, resistance to social death.
	+ In the stories that people told each other.
+ Not overt restistance: cunning, critique of anger.
+ Idea of a greater justice outside of human justice and systems that ultimately will be rewarded by God and will lead to the ultimate liberation.
	+ Either in the life afterwards or a new religious figure bringing redemption on Earth.
	+ Thinking about this as resistance.

### Collective Resistance
- Collective acts of resistance.
- Form a work group and refuse to do work.
- Form rebellions; use the tools and turn them as weapons in an attempt to liberate oneself.
- A whole series of rebellions in the 19th century that ran apace decade-by-decade.
- Some form of large scale revolt starting in 1800 with Gabriel's rebellion, 1811 in the New Orleans Uprising, etc.
+ Collective acts of overt resistance:
	+ Individual forms of resistance, but also collective forms of resistance in which groups of slaves would take action against their master.
	+ Outright rebellion or revolt; every decade in the 19th century there was a large scale slave revolt that threatened and intimidated the slavemasters that were constantly in the fear of slave resolt.
	+ True in majority-black counties (places where the black enslaved population was the majority), but also in places like Virginia and every salve state.
+ 1800 revolt: Gabriel’s Rebellion.
	+ Gabriel was a literate salve.
	+ Had been organizing with the idea that they would march to Richmond and attack white people; basic outline of the plan. 
	+ Had been assembling weapons, developing network. 
	+ Were betrayed; these slaves were captured, executed, or sold. 
+ 1811: New Orleans Insurrection. 
	+ 500 enslaved people who rebelled on the slaveholders on their own plantation. 
	+ Destroyed property, killed white slaveholders, began to march. 
	+ Slavemasters encountered the slave insurrection and used firearms to shoot and kill 66 people. 
	+ Startling admissions: intention of those that were captured were just to kill more white people. 
	+ Was not shared beyond this. 
+ 1820s: Denmark Vesey
	+ Charleston, North Carolina. 
	+ Vesey was a preacher and used his preaching to make connections in the slave quarters, developed revolt.

 
### Large Scale Slave Rebellions 
#### Nat Turner’s Rebellion 
+ 1830; was one of the more successful uprising. 
	+ Nat Turner was a preacher; saw himself as something like a chosen prophet of God. 
	+ Someone that came to lead his people out of bondage and slavery. 
+ Was successful in staging this uprising. 
	+ Several dozen enslaved peoples sized weapons, killed 60 masters and their families (including children). 
	+ Strategy was not entirely clear; met with milita and *disbanded but not captured*. 
+ Turner disappears for months; led to furious pursuit and fear of him. 
	+ Fear that Nat Turner could be **anywhere**. 
	+ Could attack and kill more white people. 
+ Found, captured, placed in prison, and tried (facing execution). 
+ Account from a journalist who interviews him: a rare insight into what happened and what Nat Turner was thinking. 
	+ Gives an account of his life full of religious symbolism; a ‘chosen prophet’; felt a calling to liberate his peoples and to lead them in ‘redemption’. 
	+ Turner’s response to doubt: “Was not Christ crucified?” 
	+ Turner is tried and executed. 

#### Gender Divide in Slave Rebellion
- Couple hundred women involved in the uprising and took arms. 
	+ Not as much as men; these men are leading the revolts 
+ Mainly men that did the running away, examples of men running south. 
	+ Some women run away, but it was mainly men. 
+ Many speculation about why this is, women perhaps felt more tied to family and children. 
	+ Perhaps had a degree of power (Jacobs’ piece; grandmother is a position of power) 
+ Women were not in fact not resisting in their own ways. 
+ Daily actions of stealing food, other forms of individual resistance were common to women. 

#### Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman
+ Truth was enslaved in New York; spoke from a long Dutch tradition (Dutch accent). Questions about the authenticity of the Am I a Woman Speech. 
	+ Is promised freedom by her master if she works for him in a single term. 
	+ New York outlaws it; the slavemaster lied to her in an attempt to get her working for further years. 
+ Truth flees but decides to leave 5 of her children; took an infant and the other children 
+ Becomes an orator to speak from her experience and to persuade people. Takes on a taken name (takes on a religious awakening and takes up her political movement work around political religious beliefs; is able to get the money to buy back her freedom.
- The master had actually sold her children down to the deep South in retaliation.

<br>

- Tubman disagreed with the notion of persuading people that slavery was bad and needed to be undone.
- Opinion: we need to take action to free as many slaves as possible.
	- Will never be possible to convince white society that change is possible.
- Led dozens of raids, making repeated trips to liberate poeple.
	- Began with her family members.
	- Led raids that would free people in groups, an extremely risky and rare move.
- One of the most hated figures of the South, one of the main reasons why the fugitive slave law is passed.
- Frees hundreds of people; once, freed 700 people at a time in South Carolina on a plantation by the river.
- Extremely militant and dedicated to large slave rebellion.

## Movement for Abolition
- Emerging movement for abilition founded in slave self-activity (slaves running away and telling their stories, leading more poeple, having more of an impact on the Christian beliefs in Slavery)
- White people became activists and movement politics around ending the institution of slavery.
- Some of the earliest are two sisters, Sarah Grtimke and Angelina Grimke.
	- Daughters of slaveowners in South Carolina.
	- Grew up with the slave system and came to see it as antithetical to their Christian beliefs.
	- Some of the frist people to decry it publically; went on speeches and made the argument against slavery.
- A growing trend of white activism.

### Quakers and the Christian Abolition
- Grimke sisters came into Quaker abolitionist circles.
- Quakers are known as a society of friends; emphasis on horizontal relationships betwene people and with God.
	- Do not need a preacher, pastor, etc. to have a direct relationships with God and other people.
- Very prominent in the state of Pennsylvania, north of the slave states Maryland and North Carolina.
- Slaves found the Quaker tradition, were interested in this horizontal, friend-based social relationships.
- Saw slavery as a moral violation of Christian principles.
- Many Northern abolitionists were Quakers.
- Even still, the white abolitonist movement was not perfect.
	- Many abolitonists saw slavery as wrong, but did not see blacks as being equal as whites in any way.
- Slavery is ended, something needs to be done to the slaves, a 'pushing out' in essence.
	- End slavery, then do something with black people as they are not *fully* equal.
	- Common solution: *Colonization.*

#### Colonization
- Sending black people back to Africa where they can have their own society and not be part of American society.
```
...unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. 
It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off.
- Henry Clay, leading American politician and abolitionist
```
- Slowly end the process of having African Americans in the Americas. 
- Solution: get rid of the source of the prejudice out of their respectability.
- An example of justifications for slavery with the paternalist ethos.

### Gradualist Abolition Before 1830
- Theodore Weld and Arthur Tappan
- Steeped in these ideas. 
- Certainly oppposed to slavery on the moral grounds and wanted to see it end.
- However, were not commited to *black equality* in that they saw blacks as inherently inferior to weights.
	- A contradiction of creating society without societally fit peoples.
- Participated in a series of activities of the 1820s or so with abolitionists along these lines.
	- Still, faced backlash: public ridicule and outrage.

### Slavery and Moral Suasion
- Moral suasion; you need to eventually convince enough people that this system is wrong, that we need to do something else.
	- We should slowly end the system and can have a slow process of abolition
	- Potential gradualist solutions: anyone born after this date will be free, some payout system, etc.
- Morally wrong, need to convince enough people of the moral wrongs of slavery.

- Into the 20th century, some African Americans embraced the idea of colonization.
- Argued of the inherent and irremovable racism in the system.
	- Some argued change was not possible and not worth provoking, developed plans for going somewhere else and creating their own society.
- A popular idea throughout the twentieth centry.
	- Liberia - founding a nation for free enslaved peoples.
- More than just talk; people were *involved* in this process.
	- Gradualist pacifist motions.

#### William Lloyd Garrison and the Liberator
- 1830s; intransigent, uncompromising, righteous, activists who denounced gradualism as passive and took action.
	- Argued that the institution of slavery was **too horrendous** to be gradualist; need to undo this immeidately, no compromise.
- Argued that this was the top priority for morally conscientious people.
- William Lloyd Garrison was the publisher of the Liberator, part of a militant abolitionist perspective.
- Put forward the claim fo immediatism, a leading white figure of abolitionism.
- *The Liberator* was very important; circulated around 100k people.
	- However, in a country of 20m people in the North and 9m in the South.
```
“I am aware that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or to speak, or write, with moderation. No! no! Tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen; — but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present. I am in earnest — I will not equivocate — I will not excuse — I will not retreat a single inch — AND I WILL BE HEARD. The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal and to hasten the resurrection of the dead.”
- William Lloyd Garrison
```
- Very few white people; *The Liberator* reader numbers were very small.

#### American Anti Slavery Society
- Abolitionist sentiments were not widespread or widely held;
	- Nevertheless are militantly committed to the righteousness of their cause and of taking action.
- Begin to found organizations that advocate for moving tpwards anti-slavery in a series of ways.
- The American Anti Slavery Society, founded in 1839 working politically and legislatively, attempting to get petititons sent to the government. 
  - Thinking about a timeline, fazing out, partial emission, etc.
  - All kinds of attempts to function in a more direct, political, ideological, and moral way.
- Slave accounts were often published by press as part of political propaganda to indicate the evils of slavery.
- Methods are being developed during this time to further push the envelope.

### Abolition, Citizenship, and Freedom
- A new kind of ideological conception of freedom, claims to rights, synthesis of ideas that we have seen, etc.
- Perhaps there are moral claims outside of legal standards for what is righteous and good.
- Maybe if we are not thinking strictly religiously, we can think of it being inherent to mankind.
  - Perhaps call them "sets of rights" *inherent* to **humanness**.
  - Everyone should have access to and should not be denied.
  
#### Universalistic Conceptions of Liberty
- An emerging univeralistic conception of liberty; one that is not tied to any sets of limitations like reason, etc.
  - You can say that one of the bases is the new intellectual tradition and new sets of writings, ideas, and histories.
    - Declaration of Independence (document that had been forgotten in the American legal tradition; not a legal document or a foundational legal piece, was written at the height of the Revolutionary War as a political statement).
    - A formerly enslaved black man - **David Walker** - uncovered the document as part of claims for immediate revolution.
    - *All men* have rights; a synthetic tradition being chrystallized to create new antiracist traditions.
- Walker is rediscovering tradition of putting new interpretation and synthesis of these ideas around universalistic claims of rights, drawing on the past.

### Abolition and Race
- Needed to be around questions of race; pro-slavery arguments like moral, Christian, civilizational, based on rights, etc. boils down to *enslaved peoples are inferior.*
- Abolitionists fought against the root-level idea that enslaved peoples were inferior.
- Pro-colonization claims (are inferior but perhaps slavery should end) begin to be undone in the 1830s to 1840s.
  - Proof: oratories, traditions, intellectual ideas, legislative documents, etc.
  - Attempting to articulate this set of ideas.
  - Producing new claims about race; coming to argue against racial inferiority and to challenge pseudoscience notions of phrenology, etc.

### Militant Abolitionism
- David Walker: wrote an appeal, political tract that re-introduced the Declaration of Independence and a more universalistic tradition of rights beyond specifying rights.
- After publication, was mysteriously killed/died for reasons historians are not entirely sure about.
  - Perhaps in retaliation for his political work.
- What emerges: type of militant abolitionism that is uncompromising, highly moral and self-conscientious, and for **full claims** of equality.
  - Not half-baked and gradualist like early intellecutal contributions.
  
### Direct Action and the Underground Railroad
- Led to direct action and work; Tubmanw as a leading figure in the underground railroad.
- John Brown participated in Underground Railroad operations.
- In Canada, he tried to stage an army to go back into the US to liberate more salves that led to the Harpers Ferry raid.

#### Harpers Ferry and John Brown
- Was in discussion with Frederick Douglass.
- Brown tried to encourage Douglass to participate; Douglass didn't know that it would work (but supported it in its righteousness).
- How to end this system entrenched in American society, politics, and economics could be ended with a few dozen?
- Brown's raid indicates the escalating militancy of abolitionism.
  - Small, but were not waiting around for gradualist change.
  - Had been involved in decades' worth of political work and not seeing much movement.

### Retaliation to Abolitionism
- Physical violence, threats.
- Boston: William Llyod Garrison is almost lynched.
  - Marched into the commons with a noose around his neck becuase he was so unpopular *in the North*.
  - Leading liberal city in the North
- Antislavery building is burned to the ground by angry mobs.
- Civil wars; white residents against black residents in New York.
  - Agains the cause of joining civilization.
- Printing presses attacked. 
- Abolitionists faced tremendous hostility and outright violence.

### Conflict in the Northern States and National Legislative Bodies
- Abolitionists/Northernors are not necessarily the same.
- Did not want to do much about it; many thought slavery was in fact right.

#### Mail Ban
- Thinking about this politically; Congress refused to take any action.
- Laws would prevent abolitionists from sending newspapers in the mail *that was guaranteed*.
- Anyone could get their newspaper published in one state or colony and have it distributed anywhere for the free exchange of ideas. 
- Congress moves to ban the distribution of abolitionist ideas in the mail system.
- Could be siezed and destroyed.

#### Gag Rule
- Banned the discussion of slavery on the Congress floor.
- Any persons or citizen can petition their government of redress; Congress must address it.
- 1840s; Congress refused to do so, banned the introduction of any abolitionist petitions, readings, and ideas from being read on the floor.
- Clear Constitutional violations. 

## Abolitionist Women
- What does this allow you to do? 
	- Cannot vote, cannot run for office, cannot petition the government, cannot write about it
	- Are met with angry mobs disrupting your ability to speech, burning down buildings, attacking the press, etc.
- Abolitionist women are encountering hostility from Americna society for even speaking on the issue.
- "Am I not a woman and a sister?" (1830s after the British Anti-slavery Society Medallion).
- Adapting the abolitionist movement from male-centric standard to women's emancipation and equality on those terms.
- Women and men both deserving of rights.
	- Universal human claims to autonomy, independence, freedom, and soforth.
- Overwhelming majority of people who ran away did not becomie movement activists.
  - Try to get a job in the North and not be involved in the level of engagement as political activists.
  - Could integrate into Northern society - still segregated - but could get work as laborers, as homeworkers, as domestic servants, etc.
- **Industrialization happening at a similar time to this.**
- Grimke sisters began to lecture; congregationalists and clergy wrote a public letter against women.
  - The thing that gives women power is defference, moral standing, etc.
  - Erodes standing in society.
- Angelina Grimke writes about the status of slaves to the status of slaves and of women.
  - Began to challenge these notions as well.
  - Changing mentality, consciousness of what conditions of slavery mean.

### London 1840 Anti Slavery Convention
- Worldwide antislavery convention held in London.
- England banned slavery in 1833.
  - Undid the colonial slave system; remaining large practioner of slavery is the United States.
  - Host a convention in which many leading antislavery activists were expected to speak.
  - (Brazil continued to practice slavery past the United States, had a horrendous slave system; Portguese slavery.)
  - First resolution past disallows women to serve as delegates or to speak at the floor.
  - Women that spent weeks on a boat to have the experience were not allowed to participate.
  - Foundational moment; basis for the emergence of the womnen's question.

### Seneca Falls
- Founded by activists; Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1840 comes back to the US; in 1848, has organized a women's rights convention in New York.
- Looking at slavery; looking at women's role in society.
- Drafted: requesting property ownership, divorce, and the right to vote.
  - A contested thing.f women's rights in tandem.

### What is Liberation?
- How do we define terms of what liberation is and what it means to be free?
- A number of different segments of American society from enslaved peoples themselves.
- Women - middle-class, abolitionist reformers, enslaved women, Northern manufacturing workers - all generating claims around liberation.
- Forms of liberation that looked different for each segment of American society yet were nontheless collectively pushing political and intellectual boundaries.

#### Forms of Resistance
- In the face of this power and oppression; what is justified?
  - Ignoring effectiveness. What is reasonable?
  - What role does violence play in this?
  - Is it righteous? Is it effective?
  - Questions women of the women's rights movement and formerly enslaved peoples were facing.
- Brown: it is time to rise up and revolt. Douglass: I'm not sure; maybe it's right, but will it work?
- Who has the social power to address these wrongs?
  - Who can make this happen, and by what means?
  - Challenging questions that abolitionists and free peoples struggled with during these decades. 
  - Frederick Douglass was part of this convention; encouraged the right to vote.
- Is ridiculed and faced many hostility.
- Many women took their name *off* the initial Declaration.
- Nontheless became a foundation for a parallel movement of women's rights in tandem.
