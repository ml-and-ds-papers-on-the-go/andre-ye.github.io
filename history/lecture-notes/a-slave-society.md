- Productivity increases: tells a story of violence.
- A metric - math - that's showing the:
  - Increasing important of slavery & cotton production
  - Wealth being generated from the cotton trade
  - How profitable it was to run a cotton plantation throughout the *modern period*.
    - A period of industrialization and urbanization.
  - Slavery remains incredibly profitable; violence drives this value.
- Graphed the efficiency of the slave system.
  - Measured the degree of violence that was used.
  
## Central Questions
- Why did slavery persist in American society for so long? Why did it take the character that it did? What factors supported the slave system? What was slavery's relatinoship to the advent of capitalism? Was the nation a slave society?
- The transition from colonial to modern slavery
  - Markets and commodites of people
  - The rise of King Cotton
  - Need to Expand, the West, and Indian Removal
- Capitalist Slavery?
  - Slavery was central to the U.S. economy
    - A 'rational' and productive system that was continuall expanding.
- A Slave Society?
  - Racial, gender, and class system modeled off slavery
  - Paternalist ethos and the cultural justifications for slavery were widely used in American society.

### Comments
- This set of lectures will focus on slavery in the 'modern era' (19th century).
- To understand the impact, one needs to think about *the economics*.
- Why does slavery become so entrenched in American society?
  - "Slave society" - virtually every aspect of the society (political, social, cultural, economic systems) touched by or designed by slavery.
- America in the 19th century was a slave society.
  - Hardly much not touched by the institution of slavery in the 1830s, 40s, 50s.
- **Why was it, and how did that come to be?**
  - What was the system of slavery?
- Move from thinking about *colonial slavery* to *modern slavery* (modern in "modern world", post-Enlightenment).
  - Institution lasted into the capitalistic period.
- An idea that slavery was slow, unproductive, unprofitable, etc; therefore it *had to die.*
  - Slavery withered and died because it could not compete with industrialization.
  - Is this theory true? Why did it last so long?
  - Relationship of capitalism to slavery.
- Was slavery antithetical to the rise of capitalism?
- **Was the United States a slave society?**

## From Colonial to Modern Slavery
- When we last say the institution of slavery, it was just being developed in colonial Virginia.
  - It was becoming *institutionalized* in forms of racial hostility and division.
  - Via law and into the economic structure and law - particularly, the Southern colonies.
- Slavery was practiced in the North (e.g. states slike New York), but was not as important as in the degree it was practiced to in the South.
- Was being institutionalized in a series of economic changes that *racialized* the practice.
  - A method of slavery just recently developing.
  - Made it particularly violent.

### Capitalist Slavery
- The system was worked into the governing framework.
  - Worked into the Constitution obliquely.
  - Recognition of slave-state senators, etc.
  - Slavery becomes an important legislative point in the Constitution.
- *Was slavery capitalist?*
  - This governs the lecture.

#### Colonial Slavery
- Look at already-developing dynamics of colonial period.
- Defining capitalism as production for profit, and the use of exploitable labor, as well as the distribution via markets, *slavery looks like it shares many similar characteristics of capitlaism.*
- Many early slaveowners had a fine calculus in terms of how to maximize ROI for slave purchases and enslaved peoples born on their plantation.
  - Jefferson would calculate how to maximize value out of people born on his plantation.
- Calculus was at play in the slave system.
- Led to treating human beings like commodities.
- Think about slaves in two ways:
  1. Their own commodification.
    - Chasing profit maximization.
  2. Labor productivity.
- When people are treated as commodities, the logic of commodities are applied.
  - Tight-pack plan for slaves in thhe 17th and 18th centuries.
- Will see at least some return on investment with this tight-back formation.
- Loose pack: Portuguese slaveship in the 19th century.
  - Conditions are different; if people have better conditions, more will survive and will have better return on investment.  
- Logic was the same: return over inestment.

#### End of Colonial Period
- At the end, the slave population looked like this:
  - Several Southern states that dominated in terms of the slave economy. Were the richest states in the colonial period.
  - South Carolina was the richest colony.
    - Did not have largest number of slaves, however had greatest proportion of slaves per capita.
    - Some counties: >90% of the population were enslaved.
    - In many, a majority were slaves.
- Environmental history:
  - The institution of slavery was defined by environmental conditions.
  - Where can slaves be put?
- Tidewater areas: Carolinas and even Georgia.
- If you were along a river, you could develop inland plantation systems.
- Dependent on a system **confined to the coast.**
- Going inland was not suited for large-scale plantation holdings.
- Most people thought that slavery would have to die out; it could not traverse the Appalachian mountains.

## Cotton
### Long and Short Staple Cotton
- With the advent of long-staple cotton, this changed. Slavery could expand.
- Cotton was an important component of textile production.
  - Large markets for this.
- Cotton is bred to thrive in a variety of environmental positions.
  - Including frostier areas.
- Is easier to harvest.
- With the invention of the cotton gin, was able to be harvested in large quantities that made it highly profitable.
- Richest states shifted from tobacco and rice to cotton.
- **Richest state shifts to Mississippi.**
  - Remains so until the Civil War.
- Long staple cotton can stand frost and does not need to stay in the Chespeake area.

### Soil Erosion
- A few years of very productive cotton harvesting will exhaust the soil.
- The productive capacity of the society is drastically decreased.
- Cotton requires lots of water.
  - Soil becomes dry and dusty.
- Cannot be productive for long periods of time.
- South Carolina planters/farmers remarked on the conditions.
  > Tens of thousands of acres of once productive lands are now reduced to the maximum of sterility. -Resident of SC farmer.
- With the advent of the *pairing of cotton production and the slave  system*, could be very profitable.

### The Need for Expansion
- Needed to expand to new areas for cotton to be grown on new lands.
- To maximize productivity, soil and landw as needed.
- Southern states were eager to push West; territories west of the Mississippi awarded in the Louisiana purchase and the Treaty of Paris.
  - Meant that there were very wide areas that the farmers could access.
- Were people that were living there.

### Indian Removal and Demand for Cotton Lands
- Initial settlement along the initial very narrowly settled region.
- British tried to enforce an arbitrary line.
- Indigenious lands thrived for centuries (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek); had well-established but disrupted adaptive strategies and developed societies in the *interior*.

#### Cherokee
- The Cherokee developed a written alphabet and began to adopt the useful aspects of European technologies for their own language.
- Translated audible sounds into an alphabet that could be used in a written language.
- Developed a political constitution in which they governed themselves.
  - Partially based on Western constitutions.
- Adopted private property. Had titles and bills of exchange.
- Adopted the leading form of property in the 18th century.
- Leading marker of achieving "civilized" status: adopted slavery.
  - The Cherokee owned slaves.
- Would sue in U.S. court and attempted to protect their property claims.
  - Would point to their constitution and their property deeds: "we're doing it by your rules, here's where it says that I own this."
  - American settlers are pushing into the interior, trying to spread this cotton plantation.
  - U.S. courts *recognized Cherokee* land titles.
  - Went to the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of famous lawsuits and the Supreme Court validated the Cherokee land claims.
  
#### Andrew Jackson and Indian Removal
- President: Andrew Jackson.
  - A famous war general active in the War of 1812.
  - When the Supreme Court went with this ruling, Jackson was intent on pushing further inland.
- Declared: "that's a very fine ruling. Let's see the courts enforce it."
- 1820s and 1830s Indian removal that had been held by the indigenious were forced out.
- **Trail of Tears:** series of forced marches beginning in 1835.
  - Cherokee peoples are removed from their territories and moved to "Indian territory" (state of Oklahoma).
- Began the reservation policy system.
- Forced march: a few Cherokee leaders made an agreement with the U.S. government to leave that few recognized.
  - Troops come to remove Cherokee from their territory.
- Led march from Georgia to Oklahoma where several thousand Cherokee died in the dead of winter.
- Was repeated with many different people from the Choctaw to the Seminole, etc.

## King Cotton
- Such removal opens up an enormous swath of territory to expand the slave system.
- The interior where cotton could grow is pushed far, far westward.
- Was no longer confined to the coastal systems.
  - Could move far inland along the Southern states.
    - Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio rivers.
    - All were suited for and developed the institution of slavery.
- Confinement on the Eastern seaboard was no longer a limitation.
- Cotton and slavery become tied together.
  - Other products became relatively irrelevant.
- Most plantations - especially those spreading West - are cotton plantations.
- Emerges as the era of 'King Cotton'.
  - Cotton becomes an important export crop.
  
### Export and Significance of Cotton
- Empire of Cotton becomes an important agricultural product for the states.
- Cotton is the **most important export commodity for international trade.**
  - Supplies 3/4 of the globe's use of cotton.
- Cotton becomes 60% of U.S. exports in this period.
  - Cotton production and trade is important because a nation that develops trade within its national boundaries cannot grow its wealth.
- Trading produces lots of wealth.
- Cotton as 60% of the exports has a dominating role in the health of the United States economy - a 'monocrop' economy.
  - e.g. based on oil production and sells its products to other countries in return for others.
- Becomes an extremely important economic factor.

## The Second Middle Passage
- Slavery is drawn much further inland.
- Populations from Carolinas needed to be marched inland.
- Charleston to New Orleans slave market.
- Slave market shifts from Charleston to New Orleans.
  - Moving from the 'upper south' (Virginia, Carolinas) into the 'deep south' (Mississippi, Arkansas).
- The "Second Middle Passage".
- Thousands of people are being sold across North America.
- Humans could be sold for profitability.
- Chains of people being marched across the territory into the Deep South.

### Slavery and the Nation
- Cotton and slavery were fused and were by far the most profitable industries in the United States.
- We have currently discussed the export of cotton; however, **slaves were the leading single asset in the U.S. economy** more so than the financial or manufacturing system in the early 19th century.
- By the 1960s, over 4 million slaves and in aggregate the largest of any real estate property in the U.S.
- Cotton is the most important export; slaves are the most important asset by value; thus a *whole series of industries are developed to facilitate this process of wealth accumulation.*
- Banks are founded in New York, Charleston, Boston to provide capital (financing) necessary.
  - Capital is needed to fund slaves.
  - Bonds for returns on future profits can be made.
  - Innovative financial mechanisms are being created.
  - Insurance: what if the ship sinks and the buyer never pays the planter?
  - U.S. financial industry getting a large boost from the institution fo slavery.

#### Manufacturing
- The largest economic engine of the New England system: **textile manufacturing.**
  - Textiles from the South, creating the first industrial corporations in the United States.
- Manufacturing purchased cotton for extremely cheap prices and converted it into profit to sell.

### The Southern Economy
- Working in the Southern economy meant working around or in association to the slave.
- Selling agriculture to these hue plantations with hundreds or even thousands of slaves that need food.
- Making anything - wagons, barrels, baskets, etc. are all used to facilitate the process of cotton harvesting and sale.

#### Plain Folk of the Old South
- Not everyone in the South owned slaves.
- 3/4 of Southern whites did not own slaves (a majority of Southern whites did not).
  - Because of economic relationships, were tied and invested in the slave system.
- Slavery was so lucrative in terms of the wealth it created and difficult to achieve; owning a slave was like a status symbol.
  - A sign that you had done all the things right; achieving peak social position for many Southerners in the early 19th century.
- Some resented the plantation owners for their wealth and *representation power*.
  - Southern planters dominated the political system.
  - Some resented this and were hostile to the Southern planters.
- West Virginia breaks off from Virginia as a state; had hostility to the slavery.

### The Planter Class
- One quarter of planters owned slaves, but most only had a few.
  - Were very few extremely large plantations.
  - Few families owned more than 100 slaves.

#### Slave System
- Prime hand: slaves were rated by 'quality'.
- A plantation that has 100 enslaved people; a lot of money for the 19th century.
- While immigrants were living on a few dollars a year, plantation owners had assets worth almost 100k or more dollars *only in slaves* (not counting other commercial properties).
- By 1860, 4 million slaves; are largest asset in the American economy
