- Productivity increases: tells a story of violence.
- A metric - math - that's showing the:
  - Increasing important of slavery & cotton production
  - Wealth being generated from the cotton trade
  - How profitable it was to run a cotton plantation throughout the *modern period*.
    - A period of industrialization and urbanization.
  - Slavery remains incredibly profitable; violence drives this value.
- Graphed the efficiency of the slave system.
  - Measured the degree of violence that was used.

### Comments
- This set of lectures will focus on slavery in the 'modern era' (19th century).
- To understand the impact, one needs to think about *the economics*.
- Why does slavery become so entrenched in American society?
  - "Slave society" - virtually every aspect of the society (political, social, cultural, economic systems) touched by or designed by slavery.
- America in the 19th century was a slave society.
  - Hardly much not touched by the institution of slavery in the 1830s, 40s, 50s.
- **Why was it, and how did that come to be?**
  - What was the system of slavery?
- Move from thinking about *colonial slavery* to *modern slavery* (modern in "modern world", post-Enlightenment).
  - Institution lasted into the capitalistic period.
- An idea that slavery was slow, unproductive, unprofitable, etc; therefore it *had to die.*
  - Slavery withered and died because it could not compete with industrialization.
  - Is this theory true? Why did it last so long?
  - Relationship of capitalism to slavery.
- Was slavery antithetical to the rise of capitalism?
- **Was the United States a slave society?**

### From Colonial to Modern Slavery
- When we last say the institution of slavery, it was just being developed in colonial Virginia.
  - It was becoming *institutionalized* in forms of racial hostility and division.
  - Via law and into the economic structure and law - particularly, the Southern colonies.
- Slavery was practiced in the North (e.g. states slike New York), but was not as important as in the degree it was practiced to in the South.
- Was being institutionalized in a series of economic changes that *racialized* the practice.
  - A method of slavery just recently developing.
  - Made it particularly violent.
  
#### Capitalist Slavery
- The system was worked into the governing framework.
  - Worked into the Constitution obliquely.
  - Recognition of slave-state senators, etc.
  - Slavery becomes an important legislative point in the Constitution.
- *Was slavery capitalist?*
  - This governs the lecture.

#### Colonial Slavery
- Look at already-developing dynamics of colonial period.
- Defining capitalism as production for profit, and the use of exploitable labor, as well as the distribution via markets, *slavery looks like it shares many similar characteristics of capitlaism.*
- Many early slaveowners had a fine calculus in terms of how to maximize ROI for slave purchases and enslaved peoples born on their plantation.
  - Jefferson would calculate how to maximize value out of people born on his plantation.
- Calculus was at play in the slave system.
- Led to treating human beings like commodities.
- Think about slaves in two ways:
  1. Their own commodification.
    - Chasing profit maximization.
  2. Labor productivity.
- When people are treated as commodities, the logic of commodities are applied.
  - Tight-pack plan for slaves in thhe 17th and 18th centuries.
- Will see at least some return on investment with this tight-back formation.
- Loose pack: Portuguese slaveship in the 19th century.
  - Conditions are different; if people have better conditions, more will survive and will have better return on investment.  
- Logic was the same: return over inestment.

#### End of Colonial Period
- At the end, the slave population looked like this:
  - Several Southern states that dominated in terms of the slave economy. Were the richest states in the colonial period.
  - South Carolina was the richest colony.
    - Did not have largest number of slaves, however had greatest proportion of slaves per capita.
    - Some counties: >90% of the population were enslaved.
    - In many, a majority were slaves.
- Environmental history:
  - The institution of slavery was defined by environmental conditions.
  - Where can slaves be put?
- Tidewater areas: Carolinas and even Georgia.
- If you were along a river, you could develop inland plantation systems.
- Dependent on a system **confined to the coast.**
- Going inland was not suited for large-scale plantation holdings.
- Most people thought that slavery would have to die out; it could not traverse the Appalachian mountains.

### Cotton
#### Long and Short Staple Cotton
- With the advent of long-staple cotton, this changed. Slavery could expand.
- Cotton was an important component of textile production.
  - Large markets for this.
- Cotton is bred to thrive in a variety of environmental positions.
  - Including frostier areas.
- Is easier to harvest.
- With the invention of the cotton gin, was able to be harvested in large quantities that made it highly profitable.
- Richest states shifted from tobacco and rice to cotton.
- **Richest state shifts to Mississippi.**
  - Remains so until the Civil War.
- Long staple cotton can stand frost and does not need to stay in the Chespeake area.

#### Soil Erosion
- A few years of very productive cotton harvesting will exhaust the soil.
- The productive capacity of the society is drastically decreased.
- Cotton requires lots of water.
  - Soil becomes dry and dusty.
- Cannot be productive for long periods of time.
- South Carolina planters/farmers remarked on the conditions.
  > Tens of thousands of acres of once productive lands are now reduced to the maximum of sterility. -Resident of SC farmer.
- With the advent of the *pairing of cotton production and the slave  system*, could be very profitable.

#### The Need for Expansion
- Needed to expand to new areas for cotton to be grown on new lands.
- To maximize productivity, soil and landw as needed.
- Southern states were eager to push West; territories west of the Mississippi awarded in the Louisiana purchase and the Treaty of Paris.
  - Meant that there were very wide areas that the farmers could access.
- Were people that were living there.

#### Indian Removal and Demand for Cotton Lands
- Initial settlement along the initial very narrowly settled region.
- British tried to enforce an arbitrary line.
- Indigenious lands thrived for centuries (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek); had well-established but disrupted adaptive strategies and developed societies in the *interior*.

#### Cherokee
- The Cherokee developed a written alphabet and began to adopt the useful aspects of European technologies for their own language.
- Translated audible sounds into an alphabet that could be used in a written language.
- Developed a political constitution in which they governed themselves.
  - Partially based on Western constitutions.
- Adopted private property. Had titles and bills of exchange.
- Adopted the leading form of property in the 18th century.
- Leading marker of achieving "civilized" status: adopted slavery.
  - The Cherokee owned slaves.
- Would sue in U.S. court and attempted to protect their property claims.
  - Would point to their constitution and their property deeds: "we're doing it by your rules, here's where it says that I own this."
  - American settlers are pushing into the interior, trying to spread this cotton plantation.
  - U.S. courts *recognized Cherokee* land titles.
  - Went to the U.S. Supreme Court in a series of famous lawsuits and the Supreme Court validated the Cherokee land claims.
  
#### Andrew Jackson and Indian Removal
- President: Andrew Jackson.
  - A famous war general active in the War of 1812.
  - When the Supreme Court went with this ruling, Jackson was intent on pushing further inland.
- Declared: "that's a very fine ruling. Let's see the courts enforce it."
- 1820s and 1830s Indian removal that had been held by the indigenious were forced out.
- **Trail of Tears:** series of forced marches beginning in 1835.
  - Cherokee peoples are removed from their territories and moved to "Indian territory" (state of Oklahoma).
- Began the reservation policy system.
- Forced march: a few Cherokee leaders made an agreement with the U.S. government to leave that few recognized.
  - Troops come to remove Cherokee from their territory.
- Led march from Georgia to Oklahoma where several thousand Cherokee died in the dead of winter.
- Was repeated with many different people from the Choctaw to the Seminole, etc.

### King Cotton
- Such removal opens up an enormous swath of territory to expand the slave system.
- The interior where cotton could grow is pushed far, far westward.
- Was no longer confined to the coastal systems.
  - Could move far inland along the Southern states.
    - Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio rivers.
    - All were suited for and developed the institution of slavery.
- Confinement on the Eastern seaboard was no longer a limitation.
- Cotton and slavery become tied together.
  - Other products became relatively irrelevant.
- Most plantations - especially those spreading West - are cotton plantations.
- Emerges as the era of 'King Cotton'.
  - Cotton becomes an important export crop.
  
#### Export and Significance of Cotton
- Empire of Cotton becomes an important agricultural product for the states.
- Cotton is the **most important export commodity for international trade.**
  - Supplies 3/4 of the globe's use of cotton.
- Cotton becomes 60% of U.S. exports in this period.
  - Cotton production and trade is important because a nation that develops trade within its national boundaries cannot grow its wealth.
- Trading produces lots of wealth.
- Cotton as 60% of the exports has a dominating role in the health of the United States economy - a 'monocrop' economy.
  - e.g. based on oil production and sells its products to other countries in return for others.
- Becomes an extremely important economic factor.

### The Second Middle Passage
- Slavery is drawn much further inland.
- Populations from Carolinas needed to be marched inland.
- Charleston to New Orleans slave market.
- Slave market shifts from Charleston to New Orleans.
  - Moving from the 'upper south' (Virginia, Carolinas) into the 'deep south' (Mississippi, Arkansas).
- The "Second Middle Passage".
- Thousands of people are being sold across North America.
- Humans could be sold for profitability.
- Chains of people being marched across the territory into the Deep South.

#### Slavery and the Nation
- Cotton and slavery were fused and were by far the most profitable industries in the United States.
- We have currently discussed the export of cotton; however, **slaves were the leading single asset in the U.S. economy** more so than the financial or manufacturing system in the early 19th century.
- By the 1960s, over 4 million slaves and in aggregate the largest of any real estate property in the U.S.
- Cotton is the most important export; slaves are the most important asset by value; thus a *whole series of industries are developed to facilitate this process of wealth accumulation.*
- Banks are founded in New York, Charleston, Boston to provide capital (financing) necessary.
  - Capital is needed to fund slaves.
  - Bonds for returns on future profits can be made.
  - Innovative financial mechanisms are being created.
  - Insurance: what if the ship sinks and the buyer never pays the planter?
  - U.S. financial industry getting a large boost from the institution fo slavery.
- Ancillary jobs rise with slavery (auctions, slave-breakers, cotton textile manufacturing, industrial revolution constructed with slavery, banking).

##### Manufacturing
- The largest economic engine of the New England system: **textile manufacturing.**
  - Textiles from the South, creating the first industrial corporations in the United States.
- Manufacturing purchased cotton for extremely cheap prices and converted it into profit to sell.

<br>

### The Southern Economy
- Working in the Southern economy meant working around or in association to the slave.
- Selling agriculture to these hue plantations with hundreds or even thousands of slaves that need food.
- Making anything - wagons, barrels, baskets, etc. are all used to facilitate the process of cotton harvesting and sale.

#### Plain Folk of the Old South
- Not everyone in the South owned slaves.
- 3/4 of Southern whites did not own slaves (a majority of Southern whites did not).
  - Because of economic relationships, were tied and invested in the slave system.
- Slavery was so lucrative in terms of the wealth it created and difficult to achieve; owning a slave was like a status symbol.
  - A sign that you had done all the things right; achieving peak social position for many Southerners in the early 19th century.
- Some resented the plantation owners for their wealth and *representation power*.
  - Southern planters dominated the political system.
  - Some resented this and were hostile to the Southern planters.
- West Virginia breaks off from Virginia as a state; had hostility to the slavery.
- Slavery works its way into American economic growth.

#### The Planter Class
- One quarter of planters owned slaves, but most only had a few.
  - Were very few extremely large plantations.
  - Few families (small proportion) owned more than 100 slaves.
- The slave system was drastically expanding.
- Become the richest Americans of the area.
- South: only one quarter of whites owned slaves.
  - If you did own slaves, however, you **made it** - you were part of the upper class.
  - Slaves that owned many slaves had unparalleled riches; part of the American elite.
  - Has tremendous political influence; were so few because the capital investment is so large.
  - Tremendous capital investment to have multiple slaves; needed access to lots of credit or outright wealth.
- Enslaved persons can then become access to further credit - can use assets for loans for more productive work to grow profit margins and productive capacity.

#### Slave System
- Prime hand: slaves were rated by 'quality'.
- A plantation that has 100 enslaved people; a lot of money for the 19th century.
- While immigrants were living on a few dollars a year, plantation owners had assets worth almost 100k or more dollars *only in slaves* (not counting other commercial properties).
- By 1860, 4 million slaves; are largest asset in the American economy

### Productivity and Labor Discipline
- Economic pressures impacted *what slaves were experiencing.*
- Attempt to manage day-by-day labor; quota system - slavemasters would purchase a slave, the slave would work for a year, and at the end of the year depending on production output would continue to raise quotas.
- 2% annual increase in productivity of plantations.
  - May not seem like a lot, but means a 4-fold level increase in production per slave.
  - Tremendously productive system.
- Back to the graph: highly planned and calculated, consciously and intentional.
  - A difficult picture to reckon with, challenging how we think about the institution of slavery and the foundation for modern America.
- We are not discussing the justifications; with this expansion, it's *a little bit embarrassing*.
  - Embarrassed to explicitly put slavery in the Constitution.
  - How to deal with this contradiction? How to justify a system like this?

#### The Paternalist Ethos and Justifications of Slavery
- Variety of ways to justify claims.
- Some were religious: looking for New Testament examples in the Bible to justify slavery.
  - Many justifications did come from the Old Testament as well.
  - One justification - carry a moral sin through lineage; story of Cane and Able as the Curse of Ham.
- *Paternalist ethos*
  - Ideas of *caring for the people*, protector status.
  - A degree of separation even within this portrayal of separation
    - Very present hierarchy.

#### White Women and Southern Patriarchy
> A man loves his children because they are weak, helpless, and dependent. He loves his wife for the similar reasons.
- So to with slaves; paternalist ethos involves in Southern paternalist ethos.
- A natural hierarchy based in gender; so to between races.
- These natural similes of hierarchies were huge justifications for slaveowners.
- Civilizational grounds: when was there a civilization that achieved greatness that did not practice slavery?
  - It's never happened; Egypt, Greece, Rome, etc. all societies that utilized slavery as the foundation for what makes civilization possible.
  - How to question? Based in wealth, natural hierarchies, and virtually permanent in society.

#### Pro Slavery Arguments
- Not an embarrassment of slavemasters, but instead a point of pride.
- Proudly forthright and public arguments made to justify the institution of slavery.
  - No shame; argued to be a natural, right, and human system.
- Counterarguments being made at the same time.

#### Abolition in the Americas
- Defenses for hte economic and social system are being made.
- Slave trade is banned in the US in 1808.
  - Still happening through piracy, but it's much more difficult.
- 1838, Britain bans slavery; pays out slavemasters as slaves become free.
- 1831; publication of *The Liberator*, the most prominent liberation newspaper in the U.S.
  - Tide of writing is growing and slaveowners are not shying away from this intellectual fight.
- Hatian revolution; tide of abolitionist sentiment.
  - First and only successful slave revolution in world history.
  - Enslaved peoples of the French colony revolt, overthrow their masters, defeat them, and create a new nation of liberated slaves called *Haiti*.
- Pro-slavery arguments were overwhelmingly defensive.
