# Notes on *Civil War: Politics and Control of the State*
Andre Ye, 12/1/20.

## Navigate

## Introduction
- Considering the far-reaching impacts of the slave system that had tentacles into many aspects of American society.
- Who has the power and desire to *end* the slave sytem?
  - What do you do?
  - How do you go about it?
- Map: Reynold's Political Map of the United States, Republican Party, 1856.
  - Making the claim that Republicans would prevent the expansion of slavery.

### Central Question
- Central question: what caused the Civil War? What brought about the abolition of slavery? Was the Civil War fought for the cause of protecting the institution of racialized slavery, or to end it?
- A dividing society
  - Differing expectations over the extent of slavery in the U.S.
  - Free soil ideology
- Conflict over Expansion
  - Missouri Compromise, Wilmot Priviso, ineffective attempts at political solutions
- Slaveocracy: control over the federal government
  - Who would control the reigns of power in Washington D.C.?
- The War that slaves made
  - Who had the interest to end slavery?
  - The Emancipation Proclamation and a wartime necessity

### Slave Resistance
- Consider: Nat Turner and John Brown.
- Really? - did it take violence to end slavery?
  - How did they envision such an revolt against a massive system?
  - What will it take to undo a sytem like this?

## Free Soil Argument
- To understand what became the Civil War, one must consider what was happening in the Northern and Southern states.
  - Important piece: the emerging political claim of Free Soil Movement, Ideology, etc.
- Basis coming from Northern farmers.
  - Growing at an exponential rate - exploding.
  - By 1860, there are ~20 million people.
- Bursting at the seams of Northern cities; Boston, New York, Philadelphia, etc.
- Idea: people would come work in the cities, then get access to the land of the West and sieze more land for independent farming.
- To create a homestead, how can one compete with slave labor?
  - A homestead next to a plantation will fail.
  - The plantation does not need to pay the slaves or a standard of living a farmer created for themselves.
  - A plantation benefited from an economy of scale.
    - Hundreds or even thousands of people are contributing to the labor, producing more efficiently and cheaply.
  - Homesteaders had no chance of competition with slaves; economic viability in danger.
- Developed the notion that the States of the West *had* to be free states.
  - Mixed/split/allowed slavery: would completely destroy the homesteader's way of life.
  - Could not compete economically; rallying cry for *Free Soil*.
  - Ensuring the lands of the West were committed to independent labor.

### Economic Growth and the Cultural Transformation
- Northern wheat farmers would sell to the South, etc.; the economics were linked to some inextricable degree.
- However, the system of producing this was quite different.
- The emphasis on yoeman husbandry in the North was more significant.
- Was a key political claim, and likely true.

## 1846 War with Mexico
- 1840: what is the Southwest of the US was the Northwest of Mexico.
- In the 1820s and 30s, question of expansion wasn't too much of a concern.
- South is running out of space, but hit another country; the rate of expansion for the North was much more vast.
  - The North had a greater *need* to expand.
  - Slavery would have been confined to the South; the North could have continued their homesteader vision and support institutions of popular democracy.
- 1840s: a quick, bloody, and decisive war occurs exactly over this question of expansion.
- President elected in 1844 - James Polk - was a slaveholder.
  - Is perhaps the only president to have traded slave from the White House.
  - Was elected on the platform of siezing California; wanted to connect the United States coast to coast.
- California was a jewel of trade and agricultural production.
- Attempted to purchase CA from Mexico, but Mexico rejected.
  - Polk siezed the land instead through war.
- War came with the benefits of Calif., Nev., Utah, and Ariz.
- Came from an independence movement in Texas, driven by Anglo-Americans that had established slave plantations against the law of the Mexican government.
- Mexican government invited settlers, but the slaveowners that came refusedd to Mexican law.
- Main thing Polk wants is California, but meanwhile there is a conflict in Texas; is used to achieve California.
- **This war disrupts the assumptions of limited expansion, leading to the Civil War.**

### Breakout of the War
- White settlers are settling in Texas and bringing slaves; by 1830 outnumber Mexican-born peoples by 2:1 or even 3:1.
- Civil War happens in Mexico, fighting over who will be politically dominant.
  - Texan slaveholders build off that momentum to build their own republic to practice slavery.
  - Mexico is not able to claim it back, but never recognize Texas as an independent country.
- 10 years later, Texan petition to be a state and the US recognizes them.
  - Polk sends in federal troops to Texas; the Mexican government sends troops into Texas as well.
- Polk begins a declaration of war.

### Results and Conclusions
- Decisively win, invade the Mexican capital, conquer the government.
- Force a harsh peace treaty in which they claim a third of the Mexican nation, all the way to California.
  - Connecting Texas to California.

## Problems of the Empire
- Our initial map: opened up the Southern territory, meant that the Southern US had to answer a question of who and what would settle.
- Plantation owners know they cannot do plantations in the desert; end the Missouri Compromise, allow for settlement into Northern and Southern territories.
  - Viewed as the determining provocation in the war.
