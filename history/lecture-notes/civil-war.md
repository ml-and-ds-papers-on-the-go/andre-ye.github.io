## Introduction
- Considering the far-reaching impacts of the slave system that had tentacles into many aspects of American society.
- Who has the power and desire to *end* the slave sytem?
  - What do you do?
  - How do you go about it?
- Map: Reynold's Political Map of the United States, Republican Party, 1856.
  - Making the claim that Republicans would prevent the expansion of slavery.

### Central Question
- Central question: what caused the Civil War? What brought about the abolition of slavery? Was the Civil War fought for the cause of protecting the institution of racialized slavery, or to end it?
- A dividing society
  - Differing expectations over the extent of slavery in the U.S.
  - Free soil ideology
- Conflict over Expansion
  - Missouri Compromise, Wilmot Priviso, ineffective attempts at political solutions
- Slaveocracy: control over the federal government
  - Who would control the reigns of power in Washington D.C.?
- The War that slaves made
  - Who had the interest to end slavery?
  - The Emancipation Proclamation and a wartime necessity

### Slave Resistance
- Consider: Nat Turner and John Brown.
- Really? - did it take violence to end slavery?
  - How did they envision such an revolt against a massive system?
  - What will it take to undo a sytem like this?

## Free Soil Argument
- To understand what became the Civil War, one must consider what was happening in the Northern and Southern states.
  - Important piece: the emerging political claim of Free Soil Movement, Ideology, etc.
- Basis coming from Northern farmers.
  - Growing at an exponential rate - exploding.
  - By 1860, there are ~20 million people.
- Bursting at the seams of Northern cities; Boston, New York, Philadelphia, etc.
- Idea: people would come work in the cities, then get access to the land of the West and sieze more land for independent farming.
- To create a homestead, how can one compete with slave labor?
  - A homestead next to a plantation will fail.
  - The plantation does not need to pay the slaves or a standard of living a farmer created for themselves.
  - A plantation benefited from an economy of scale.
    - Hundreds or even thousands of people are contributing to the labor, producing more efficiently and cheaply.
  - Homesteaders had no chance of competition with slaves; economic viability in danger.
- Developed the notion that the States of the West *had* to be free states.
  - Mixed/split/allowed slavery: would completely destroy the homesteader's way of life.
  - Could not compete economically; rallying cry for *Free Soil*.
  - Ensuring the lands of the West were committed to independent labor.
- Missouri Compromise - limits expansion of slavery northwards.
- Told slavery to stay in the South, perfectly happy to keep slavery.

### Economic Growth and the Cultural Transformation
- Northern wheat farmers would sell to the South, etc.; the economics were linked to some inextricable degree.
- However, the system of producing this was quite different.
- The emphasis on yoeman husbandry in the North was more significant.
- Was a key political claim, and likely true.

## 1846 War with Mexico
- 1840: what is the Southwest of the US was the Northwest of Mexico.
- In the 1820s and 30s, question of expansion wasn't too much of a concern.
- South is running out of space, but hit another country; the rate of expansion for the North was much more vast.
  - The North had a greater *need* to expand.
  - Slavery would have been confined to the South; the North could have continued their homesteader vision and support institutions of popular democracy.
- 1840s: a quick, bloody, and decisive war occurs exactly over this question of expansion.
- President elected in 1844 - James Polk - was a slaveholder.
  - Is perhaps the only president to have traded slave from the White House.
  - Was elected on the platform of siezing California; wanted to connect the United States coast to coast.
- California was a jewel of trade and agricultural production.
- Attempted to purchase CA from Mexico, but Mexico rejected.
  - Polk siezed the land instead through war.
- War came with the benefits of Calif., Nev., Utah, and Ariz.
- Came from an independence movement in Texas, driven by Anglo-Americans that had established slave plantations against the law of the Mexican government.
- Mexican government invited settlers, but the slaveowners that came refusedd to Mexican law.
- Main thing Polk wants is California, but meanwhile there is a conflict in Texas; is used to achieve California.
- **This war disrupts the assumptions of limited expansion, leading to the Civil War.**

### Breakout of the War
- White settlers are settling in Texas and bringing slaves; by 1830 outnumber Mexican-born peoples by 2:1 or even 3:1.
- Civil War happens in Mexico, fighting over who will be politically dominant.
  - Texan slaveholders build off that momentum to build their own republic to practice slavery.
  - Mexico is not able to claim it back, but never recognize Texas as an independent country.
- 10 years later, Texan petition to be a state and the US recognizes them.
  - Polk sends in federal troops to Texas; the Mexican government sends troops into Texas as well.
- Polk begins a declaration of war.

### Results and Conclusions
- Decisively win, invade the Mexican capital, conquer the government.
- Force a harsh peace treaty in which they claim a third of the Mexican nation, all the way to California.
  - Connecting Texas to California.

## Problems of the Empire
- Our initial map: opened up the Southern territory, meant that the Southern US had to answer a question of who and what would settle.
- Plantation owners know they cannot do plantations in the desert; end the Missouri Compromise, allow for settlement into Northern and Southern territories.
  - Viewed as the determining provocation in the war.
- America is thinking of itself as an empire of democracy and enlightenment, individual freedom, etc.
  - Ideological grounding in expansion: all sorts of economic factors pushing U.S. settlement out.
  - Cotton production and the expansion of slavery (acquiring new fertile lands).
  - Slave plantations are looking to expand upon the South.
  - North is seeing a population explosion, many immigrants coming looking for work.
    - Thinking: cities cannot handle millions of people, need to expand West.
    - Homestead Act - delegate property to those that have it.
    - 1860: 20 million people, millions of people streaming into the west to fulfill hometeads.
  - Adams Family: thought America would conquer Cuba and the Carribean; notion of there being no limit to US expansion.
- Territory is opened up and threatens to *undo* the Miouri Compromise.
  - Slavery could not expand upon it, but Southerners are pushing against it.
  - Southern plantations had, for instance, siezed Texas.

### Wilmot Proviso and Compromise of 1850
- Stated that any new territories from the war could not have slavery.
- Completely voted ground; Southern votes controlled the house and the Senate.
- Created a new compromise: Compromise of 1850. 
- Allowed California to not be a slave state, but allowed everything else acquired during the Mexican War (New Mexico, Arizona, etc.) can be opened for slavery settlement.
  - Led to further reversals.
- Wilmot Proviso fails and is changed by the Compromise of 1850

### Kansas Nebraska Act
- Another reversal/redefinition: Congress allowed territories to decide by popular vote if they would be free or slave states.
- Allowed Nebraska and Kansas to have a rush of settlement from slave and free-staters to establish them as free/slave states.
- Led to violence as each side tried to drive out the other.
- Plantation owners would settle and drive out small farmers, retaliated with massacres.
  - Late 1850s (including John Brown) who were shooting it out in the open territory of Kansas.

## Fugitive Slave Law and Abolition
- Congress passes 1850 Fugitive Slave Act.
  - Requires Northern states to return fugitive slaves.
  - Slaves escaping at the rate of thousands a year.
- Extensive network of those funneling slaves into the North and Canada.
- Southernors losing hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.
  - A major concern.
- Through control of Congress, pass a law that requires Northern states to return slaves.
- Accused people had no right to a jury or someone to testify on their behalf.
  - A free person would not petition or change the decision.
- Northern states needed to pay people to capture and return escaped slaves.
  - Before, they could say that if people came there, then so be it.
- Now, they are required to support slavery.
  - Seem to be an encroachment on their agency.
- Fugitive slave act is passed.

## Slave Power
- Essentially, Southernors controlled the federal government; slavemasters in particular.
- The South has a much smaller population than the North (maybe 9 million people, vs 20 million people).
- Number of slave states and free states was paired for Senatorial representation, equal.
  - Vote could be closer divided, Southern states only needed to convince one Northernor with them to pass these.
- In the House, because of the 3/5 clause, an enslaved person counted as 3/5 of a vote. Slaves were being counted towards electoral votes without having any say in the proces.
  - Southern slaveholders have a huge electoral advantage based on this system.
  - South controls the House and the Senate.
- Have virtually every American preident in the period before the Civil War.

### Control of the Government
- Control of the presidency of slaveowners meant that they controlled the Supreme Court, appointing pro-slavery justices throughout the 19th century.
- Northerners begin to call this the "slave power" or the "slaveocracy".
- Fairly undemocratic control of government by Southern plantation owners that they couldn't break; kept on losing.
- Kept on becoming more and more egregious; perhaps the Missouri Compromise was reasonable, and if it was untouched, slavery would have continued far longer.
- As Southernors continued to push slavery, they began to antagonize Northern political actors.
- Especially in the House, had sympathetic Northern politicans that voted with Southern politicans (called "dough-faces" - soft and easily malleable in votes).
- Compromises are undone, the Fugitive Slave Act is passed, and there is hope that the Courts can undo some of this.
  - However, the Courts are controlled by slaveowners.
  - 1857; Supreme Court passes a decision known as the *Dred Scott Case*.

### Dred Scott
- Enslaved in Missouri, one of the Northern slave states.
- Taken out into an obstensibly free territory with no laws enforcing slavery.
- Dred Scott declares himelf free; emancipates himself.
- His slavemaster sues; do the Northern states need to recognize slavery passed in their own territories?
- Supreme Court rules with the slavemaaster; says that free states not only need to recognize the institution of slavery, but does not need to recognize the political rights of black people at all.
  - Said that black people were not intended to be included under the word 'citizen' that provides sets of rights like the ability to sue in court.
- It was found egregious at the time, yet another overreach by Southernors eager to protect this institution.
- Southern "fire-eaters" politicians - would not even tolerate a question or debate on slavery; to question the morality of slavery would be to shake their entire world view and principles.
  - Many were elected officials; would produce the gag rule, fugitive slave law, etc. to squash any debate or compromise on slavery.

## The Republican Party and Free Labor
- Many Northernors began to become frustrated.
  - The South could not be imposing their values of slavery against the free states.
  - The North decides not to practice slavery, needs to be negotiated with on the expansion of slavery.
- The bulk of the expansion West needs to be free.
- Was the basis for the Republican Party; was not *against* the Institution of Slavery but against the slaveocracy.
  - Against slavemaster being able to dictate national policy.
- Northern industry wanted high tariffs on their industries; conflicts over the economic issues and foreign policy issues on the question of expansion.
- Northern political interests had become frustrated enought to advocate for the limiting of slavery and spreading of free labor.

### The Election of Lincoln
- In 1860, they run a senator from Illinois; Abraham Lincoln who *wins*.
- Wins without a single Southern electoral vote. Wins with no Southern votes at all.
- The South declare that they are leaving the Union and declaring themselves their onw nation.
  - Was a four-way race, not just between the Northern or the Southern candidate.
  - Was a Northern democrat running, for example.
- Urban populations would vote Democrat, the vote got fractured; Lincoln was able to carry all of the Northern state.
- Why did the South secede? Republicans are not actually opposed to slavery but the South just leaves.
  - Even if they didn't believe Lincoln was about to take slaves, the writing on the wall was there; the growing majority would eventually take over and take control of the government.
  - No tolerance for this; the propagandist element.
  - Many states seceded *before* the inauguration.
  - Lincoln's policy: keeping the Union together, regardless of slavery being practiced or not.

## The Secession Crisis
- South Carolina goes out first, state militias in Southern states are siezing federal property.
- When a resupply ship goes to a federal base in the South, it is attacked by these militas and prevented from refueling.
- Federal troops and southern militias are shooting against each other, in a Civil Conflict.
- Several Southern states go out a well as a respond to pruported Northern aggression.
- Fighting occurs at Fort Sumnter.
- Not all the slave states join the Confederacy - **four slave states ('Border states') remain.**
  - Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Deleware.
- Important, because the capital of the nation is sandwiched between Virginia and Maryland.
  - Keeping the Maryland and other border slaves in the Union were very important.

### The First Modern War
- In previous eras, kings, emporers, governments could assemble an army and have them go fight somewhere.
- This was a war that had met the industrial process and met industrialization.
- First war to happen on the other side of industrialism.
- The ability to produce vast amounts of weaponry and war technology, applying industrial technologies to mechanisms of death, like machine guns, means that the ability to kill is greatly expanded.
- New technologies means that not muskets or even rifled muskets are being used; guns could be fired much faster and were much more accurate.
- With that new scale of killing, new people had to step up to that place.
  - New people, new materials, new uniforms, new weapons, etc. need to be done.
  - Tranportation to mobilize the entire army.
- Society needs to be mobilized to make the new war effort possible.

### The Technology of War
- The mobilization efforts to win the war underwent a technological revolution.
  - The longer the war, the more it favors the North.
- However, the South has slave labor, which the North does not have.
- Were hoping that slave labor could make the difference, and relied on that for their production.
- The first modern war is by far the deadliest war in United States history.
- Over 600,000 people are killed in the 5 years.
  - Greater than all other U.S. wars combined.
  - Only recently have those numbers reached parity.
- Older war tactics are meeting new war technologies and leading to a horrendous outcomes.

## The War that Slaves Made
- The notion of Contraband Camps: what first happens in 1s and 2s become dozens and thousands of slaves.
- Definitive towards forcing emancipation; this becomes a crucial war aim.
- The Southern society needs slaves as its one advantage and forces the North to recognize emancipation.
- Pay close attention to what is happening in the Emancipation Proclamation.
