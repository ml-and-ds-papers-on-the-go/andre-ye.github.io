### Introduction
- First industrialized workforce in the US was all women.
- Textile manufacturing was done exclusively by women.
  - Universally true **to this day**.
- Women and Their Work in the Metropolis, Stanley Fox, *Harper's Bazaar*, 1868
  - Illustration: industrial work as a natural extension of the domestic sphere?
  - Depicting several illustrations of women in manufactures revolving around an image of a woman looking after her child (domestic sphere)
  - These professions were **not safe** and 'womanly', as portrayed.
      - e.g. Toy Painters. fumes from paint.

<br>

 ### Key Questions and Points
 - **Central Questions:** Why were the first industral workers primarily women? What ways to systems of gender and the economy, patriarchy and capitalism, relate to one another?
 - Industrial capitalism
  - Combination of market capitalism with new source of productive power.
    - Creation of wage labor.
    - Transformation of the environment with significant consequences.
    - *Wage slavery?*
- Gender Theory: Gender Constructions and their Class Character
  - The "Cult of Domesticity" - Working Women too?
    - Women's cheapness?

<br>

<br>

### Household Economy and Social Parity
- In order to understand changes of industrial revolution, (epoch-defining moment) look at *what came before.*
- Pre-industrial revolution: **the household was the economic unit.**
  - Not just a place of rest.
  - A place of economic activity *for both men and women.*
  - True in agrarian production (house as the extension of a farm and field).
    - Women to perform ancillary work to allow agrarian work to pass.
    - Gender division of labor within economic units.
      - Men and women would have different sets of tasks.
      - True almost universally.
        - Indigenous societies - women did the planting and harvesting.
    - Men and women found work in the household.
  - The household became a unit of **economic power**.
    - Women performed tasks like: repair tools, make satchels for harvesting, make food, 'reproductive work'

#### Artisanal Labor
- Household as the individual unit - tied to home production.
- Artisanal production: *complete manufacture of some thing.*
  - From end to end, artisans can completely craft something.
  - Often hand-made.
  - Artisan must know every stage of creation.
- Cooper, shipwright, smiths, etc.
  - Performing every stage of production to create, e.g., barrel.
  - Going **from zero to finished product.**
- Artisan apprentices.
- **Controls the entire work process.**
  - Control speed.
- Sell *what they made.*

#### Agrarian Power
- Source of power is human (or animal) muscle power.
  - Body power *empowers the process.*
- The extent to which production is possible is the extent to which human bodies can produce something.

<br>

<br>

### Market Revolution and Social Transformation
- Transformations happening *slowly*.
  - Pre-industrial; advent of the 'market revolution' and capitalism.
- **Market Revolution of the 18th century.**
  - People were drawn into commercial relationships of exchange based on currency and tender.
    - Debt, credit, market relationships.
  - 17th century, people in a yoeman household probably produced everything by themselves.
    - Need as sweater, make a sweater.
  - 18th century, people are drawn into networks of commercial exchange.
    - Specialize in a particular skill of expertise.
    - You can sell yourself and get access to a money market economy.

#### The Transportation Revolution
- Constructing canals. Waterways main network of exchange (pre-industrial railroad).
- Water way access becomes key trading area.
- Advent of Eerie Canal in early 19th century.
  - Connects Hudson River; opens up the entire continent into Chicago and the great plains.
  - Isolated farmers can get their products into major hubs within a few weeks.
  - **Not industrial steam power.**
    - Barges pulled by horses.
    - Still relied on physical labor.
- Regardless, the network allowed people to buy and seel goods that they had never before.

<br>

<br>

### Division of Labor
- The type of work women were doing in the household could be much more lucrative.
- They could sell their labor to other markets
- Women who were doing weaving or textile making could spend more time doing that (assembling goods) and get money to **buy other things they might need.**
  - Otherwise would need to make on their own.
- Work in the household *being monetized.*
- Over time, **collectivize and aggregate isolated points of labor.**
  - Develop a process in which economies of scale could be produced.
  
#### Putting Out System
- Even if not being aggregated in the same place, it can be *socially aggregated.*
- Women could do work in their home, *put out* their work.
  - Collected, paid women, and assembled to sell.

<br>

<br>

### Industrial Revolution
- **Epoch-defining transformation in human history.**
- Combination of capitalist production relationships and industrial power sources.
- **Externalizing source of productive power from limitations of the human body.**
  - The human body can only produce *so much.*
- Rapid growth in *machinery* powered by nonhuman sources.
- Driving industrial capitalism:
  - Shift in the energy regime and social organization underlying society.

<br>

<br>

### Industrial Power
#### Water
- Driving the industrial production and expansion: water.
  - Anything that can burn (wood, forests, coal, oil). Before this: water.
- Being located near water helped.
- Water that had a 'drop' (using gravity to drive motion).
- New England: factories were located around **water sources*.
  - Very first textile mill in the United States (Slater Mill in Massachusetts) outside of Boston.
  - In order to make the mill work, channel water underneath the factory to drive a turbine connected to machinery.
  - Dammed the river to control the flow.

#### Textile Production
- **Cotton textiles were the number one manufactured product.**
- Water can be linked to drive the 'power loom'.
- Transforming hand loom; externalizing driving forces of loom to water.
- Looms are connected by belts to turbines, all driven **in uniform**.
- Emphasis on efficiency of production.
- Every floor could specialize.
  - First floor - spin into thread.
  - Second floor - thread into textiles.
  - Third floor - died and packages, etc.
- Driven by **central power source.**

<br>

<br>

### Dramatic Environmental Impacts
- Need to be located at sites where *there is potential for power.*
- Lowell, 1845
  - Within a few decade, transformed into an industrial city.
    - Based on the new method of manufacturing and textile production.
  - Water enabled textile production.
  - River is lined with factory.
    - When waterfront fills up, build canals.
  - Water could serve as acess to markets.
- Controlling the flow of the water was a major problem for early industrialists.

#### Pollution on the Concord River
- 1921. Dyes could be put in the river.
- Industrial pollutants.
- One of the first signs that industrial production and technology would have significant environmental impacts.

#### The Merrimack River Watershed
- **Transforms the law.**
  - The path of rivers changed
  - Property rights altered to support industrialism.
- Unintended consequences.
- Lowell *was* a farming community.
- If, as an industrialist, you dam the river and the resulting flow is a trickle?
- Lawsuits - farmers would sue industrialists.
  - River flows through property, infringing on property rights.
  - Sued but court did not side with them.
    - Farmer-farmer relationship: not acceptable.
    - Industrialist-farmer damming relationship: acceptable.
      - Industrialists bribing, corruption?
      - Emminent domain
    - Partially on **Lockean grounds.**
      - The most industrious and efficient use of space.
      - Lockean principles of property.
  
#### Waltham Bostom Manufacturing Company Mill
- Very large manufactures being constructed very quickly.
- Primary interest in generating as much profit as possible.
- Builders are cutting corners - leads to the first series of industrial accidents.

#### Industrial Accidents
- Largest accident in US history up to then - 1860 collapse of Hemberton Mill
  - Lawrence, Massachusetts
- Factory collapsed, 145 deaths of factory workers.
  - 100-something injured.
- Within a few decades, it has been completed translated.

### Social Impacts on Industrialization: Labor
- People's relationship **to their labor.**
  - How is labor used?
  - Social relationships.
- Gender  - the shift of power: externalizing from physical bodies to turbine power sources that could drive machinery.
  - Metaphorical as well - changing the relationship of power to which people have with their own bodies.
  - You are no longer working and your own pace and control.

#### Cheap Labor and Women
- Industrial labor - you are working to the pace of the machine.
  - Adapt your physical standards to that of industrial production.
- Widespread **labor discipline**.
  - A factory that is all operating at the same time.
  - Throughput production contingent on each part of the process being accomplished at the same time.
  - *Everyone needs to be present and working at the same pace.*
    - A few people who are late: can be a catastrophe for the production process.
    - Need a regime of labor discipline to make systems work.
- **If you need so many people, why are women being employed?**
  - Women's labor was cheap.
    - *Cheaper*.
  - *Why* was women's labor cheaper?
    - Industrial process - *removes the limitations of physical bodies from production.*
    - Perhaps gendered division worked agrarian production, but how does it make sense in production?
- **Answer**:
  - Labor supply
  - Expectations
  - Oppurtunities elsewhere
  - Not the main moneymakers of the family.
- *What does it mean to say that women's labor is cheaper?*

<br>

---

<br>

### Cult of Domesticity
- Cultural standards going into evaluating what labor is worth.
- A man or a woman is doing the same amount of labor.
  - can we say that it's about production? No.
- A series of factors go into influencing what women's labor was worth.

#### Standards on Social Participation
- Development of cult of domesticity.
- Separate sphere standard, 'cult of true womanhood'
- Idea that *women's only or natural social role is tied to family, home,a dn domestic considerations.*
  - Anything with public involvement (work), politics, intellectual pursuits, etc. seen as outside of her 'natural sphere'.
- Severe restrictions and limitations on what women's acceptable social role was.

<br>

---

<br>

### Women and Labor Markets
- Women's access to labor markets in the early 19th century was highly restricted.
  - Domestic servant (maid, cleaner, cook), as a nurse (medical aid), or a teacher.
  - Limited options.
  - Professional: property, business, politics, law: closed to women. 
  - Women did not have full and equal access to the full scope of labor markets.

#### Industrial Labor
- Impacted access to labor market.
- Overabundance and supply in availability for this type of work.
  - There weren't very many options.
- In a labor market, when you have a huge labor abundance, the price of labor goes down.
- _A confluence of cultural expectations & cultural standards that influence economic variables._
- 'Cheapness' is being constructed along ideological constructions *and* the advent of markets being applied to humans.
  - Labor being sold in sets of markets.
  - People's cultural ideas are influencing this.

#### Social Impacts of Industrialization: Wages
- What does it mean, then, to be a factory girl?
- Example: Time Table.
  - 1868 Time Table of the Lowell Mills
  - Arranged to make the working time 60 hours per week.
  - The standard time will be marked at noon, by the bell of the Merrimack Manufacturing Company.
  - Locking the gates.
  - 12 hour workday. 
  - Compelled to certain time restrictions.
- People were selling wages (a new mechanism)
  - People are selling their labor for a certain amount of time.
  - Not selling a barrel or some artisanship craft, you are selling yourself and your time.

#### Beauties of Our Factory System - Otherwise, Lowell Slavery

```
Let oppression shrug her shoulders,
And a haughty tyrant frown,
And little upstart Ignorance,
In mockery look down,
Yet I value not the feeble threats
Of Tories in disguise,
While the flag of Independence
O'er our noble nation flies.

Oh! isn't it a pity, such pretty girl as I
Should be sent to the factory to pine away and die?
Oh! I cannot be a slave, I will not be a slave,
For I'm so fond of liberty,
That I cannot be a slave.
```

- Comparison of status as a worker in the factories to **slavery**.
  - Writing this at a time when *chattel slavery actually existed.*
- Relationships of wage.
- Correct comparison with slavery?
  - *Probably not.*
  - Not subjected to violence, not really owned.
  - Begs further explanation.

### Productivity and Labor Discipline
- It's not outside of the realm of reasonableness to make the comparison.

#### The Lords of the Loom and the Lords of the Lash
- Being sold and gathered in labor regimes
- Comparisons between slaveholders and overseers.
- Foremen looking over your work, you were not independent in how you were doing your work.

#### The Liberator and Abolitionist Debate

```Our wealthy citizens, as a body, are hostile to the interests fo the laboring classes? Is it not found int heir commercial enterprise, which whiten the ocean with canvas, and give employment to a useful and numerous class of men; it is not found in their manufacturing which multiply labor and cheapen necessities... It is a miserable characteristic of human nature to look with an envious eye upon those whoa re more fortunate in their pursuits, or more exalted in their station."
```

- Abolitionists debated this.
  - If you're talking about abolition, include the wage system.
- Debates in the pages of the abolitionist press: should we include the waged system as part of the system of slavery, or not?
- Leading abolitionist figure: **William Llyod Garrison.**
  - Writing to *The Liberator*: if in favor of abolition, it must not only be African slavery but industrial slavery.
  - Garrison disagreed; believed that the two systems were not comparable.
- Industrialism *produced and rising the tide for everyone*, Garrison argued.
  - To say otherwise would be envious.
  - Not fair to proclaim that these institutions are like slavery.

#### Liberator Debate
- Published retorts (have an exchange)
- William West:
  - Similarities between wage system and slavery.

```
The value and the price of labor have been rated not by the worth of their product, but by the power of those whoc ommand its proceeds, or for whom it is performed - to obtain it, and enjoy its benefits.
```

```
You are striving to excite the attention of your countrymen to the injustice of holding their fellow men in bondage and deprivign them of the fruit of their toil. We are aiming at a similar object.
```

#### Labor Theory of Value
- Labor is creating value but not getting its share from the proceeds.
> The labor theory of value (LTV) is a theory of value that argues that the economic value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of "socially necessary labor" required to produce it. The LTV is usually associated with Marxian economics, although it also appears in the theories of earlier classical economics such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo and later also in anarchist economics. Smith saw the price of a commodity in terms of the labor that the purchaser must expend to buy it, which embodies the concept of how much labor a commodity, a tool for example, can save the purchaser. The LTV is central to Marxist theory, which holds that the working class is exploited under capitalism, and dissociates price and value. Marx did not refer to his own theory of value as a "labour theory of value". -Wikipedia

#### Fredrick Douglass on Wages
> Experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and this this slavery of wages must go down with the other.
- Should be included in the abolitionist movement, but not *exactly* the same.
- We should question the value of 'little'.

<br>

<br>

### Industrial Women
- Reworking of the social fabric of American society.
- Requires transformations of economic and social spheres.
- Transforms the social role of women.
- Repeating question: *Why were women the first industrial workforce?*
