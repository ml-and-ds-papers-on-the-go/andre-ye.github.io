### Introduction
- *Ironworkers Noontime*, Thomas Anschutz, 1880.
- Racially exclusive labor.
- *Are all of the workers white?*
- What does it mean to be white in industrial America?
- What is the purpose of the painting?
  - Comradarie and rivalry - complexities.
  - Constructions of gender (all male).

- **Central questions:** What is whiteness? What are factors that contribute to the construction of race? How have specific definitions of race changed over time? How do structures of immigration, law, and economics make race?
  - Constructions of Whiteness tied to Immigration and Citizenship
    - Naturalization Act of 1790
    - Labor Market competition fosters ethnic/racial divisions
    - Rise of Nativist anti-immigrant movements
  - Comparing Irish and Chinese immigration
    - Different Push/Pull factors
    - Irish Immigrants and Difference
    - Legal standards - 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act
    - Immigrants and racialization
  - Whiteness as a 'social wage'
    - Whiteness not as a fixed category but as a social construction
    - Pays dividends to its holders

### Legal Cornerstones of American Immigration and Constructions of Whiteness
- The Constitution does not explicitly condone racism.
  - It uses 'euphamisms'.
- Legal foundations: Naturalization Act (1790)
> ...any alien, being a free white person, who shall have resided within the limits and under the jurisdiction of the United States for a term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen thereof...
- Passed at the second session of the First Congress of the United States in New York City on January 4th, 1790, ending August 12th, 1790.
- The very first explicitly racially stated law.
- First Congress seeks to define what a citizen is.
  - Ties citizenship to whiteness.
- Benjamin Franklin:
  > the Number of purely white People in the World is proportionally very small. All Africa is black or tawny. Asia chiefly tawny. America (exclusive of the new Comers) wholly so. And in Europe, the Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion, as are the Germans also, the Saxons only accepted, who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased. And while we are, as I may call it, Scouring our Planet, by clearing America of Woods, and so making this Side of our Globe reflect a brighter Light.
  - Frames race by nationality.
  - Reinforces ideas of Anglo-Saxon self-governing superiority.

#### Ante-Bellum Immigration
- 4 million immigrants between 1840 and 1860.
- Phase 2: 1820-1890
  - 15 million immigrants.
  - Mostly German, Irish, Scandanavians, British.
    - Some Chinese, French, Canadians, Western Europeans.
- Irish - religiously different.
  - Most of England adopted Protestantism.
  - Ireland remained Catholic after the Roamn Conquest.
  - A distinct group that come to the United States in huge numbers.
- Ante-Bellum: the period preceding the civil war.
  - Latin: before war (Ante-Bellum), referencing the civil war.
- Being defined by industrialism.

### Early Industrialization
- Why do historians break it up in this way?
  - Pre 1820, there wasn't much of an industrial process.
- What happened in Lowell?
  - The corporations in Lowell needed cheap labor.
  - Hired women because they couldn't find anyone else.
- As more immigrants came, they began to hire more immigrants.
- Ethnic heterogeneity introduced complicating factors. 
- Labor is being sold on markets.
  - Come to do work and would sell that object.

<br>

### Unions
#### Unions and Economism 
- Herbert Gutman: writes about the immigrant experience in relation to labor.
- Labor markets: immigrants are coming to search for jobs.
  - Explodes the numbers.
  - 4 million people coming to pre-Industrial New England, flooding labor markets and has a competitive factor.
  - Whoever is willing to work for the cheapest will get the job.
- Workers are attempting to develop mechanisms to prevent competition from eroding working standards, compensation, and conditions.
  - Limit market access to jobs; thus they can benefit.
- Unionization is **the leading mechanism** developed to make this mechanism.
  - In order to work, you must be in a Union organization.
  - Restricts how many people can come work in a workplace.
  - Elevates and raises wages for people who are working by restricting market competititon.
- Unions emerged as one of the early mechanisms to deal with this.

#### Unions and Racial Exclusivity
- Unions used racial exclusivity; union members needed to be white (or not a woman or not black or not Irish, etc.)
- Excluded populations that would otherwise be competing in the labor market for the same sets of jobs.
- Unions can form as a market constriction while embracing exclusivities.

### Constructions of Working Class Masculinity
- Competitiveness is contributing to constructing concepts of masculinity in terms of how people navigate the new environment.
- Constructions center around toughness, conflict, and aggression.
- Work itself was extremely dangerous.
  - No workplace protections.
  - Safety of workers is not being considered.
  - Industrial accidents and hazards.
  - 30,000 people are being killed a year.
- Additional competition to 'muscle out' other workers in order to gain access to those jobs.
- Constructions of masculinity in the early 19th century along factors of aggression, competition, and toughness.
  - Proving grit in the face of adversity.

<br>

### Whiteness Structural Components
#### Citizenship
- Access to enfranchisement and legal representation through voting.
- Favored naturalization legislation.

#### Jobs
- Within labor markets, whiteness is defined through exclusion.
- Privledged access to jobs, better working conditions, etc.
- There is real meaning and benefit in being defined as white.
- Recommending reading: *The Wages of Whiteness* by David R. Roediger
- Whiteness becomes meaningful by exclusion from job markets.

### Famine Migration and the Legacy of Globalism and Colonialism

#### The Irish Famine
- Population of Ireland, 1791-2001:

| Year | Population in Millions |
| --- | --- |
| 1791 | 4.8 |
| 1841 | 8.2 |
| 1851 | 6.6 |
| 1891 | 4.7 |
| 2001 | 5.5 |

- A loss of two million people (75% reduction) in just 10 years from 1841 to 1851.
  - Ireland never recovered its pre-famine population.
- Major push factor: **famine**.
  - Irish potato famine and environmental catastrophe.
- Potato famine worsened by monocrop cultures, where everyone plants only one plant.
  - A fungus or a virus spreads very easily.
  - The Irish potato was a staple of the Irish diet.
  - Many of the other lands to produce wheat; was being imported into England to support growing industrializations.
  - Singular diet - the potato - is dying.
- Famine and poverty, hunger, death.
- Massive exodus; people left Ireland in droves.

#### Irish Immigration to the United States
- Coming to the United States.

| Decade | Immigration to the US |
| --- | --- |
| 1830s | 207,000 |
| 1840s | 780,000 |
| 1850s | 914,000 |
| 1860s | 435,000 |
| 1870s | 436,000 |
| 1880s | 655,000 |
| Total 1820-2000 | 4.7 million |

- Irish immigrants stood out.
  - Practiced a different religion, spoke a different language (Gaelic), looked different, had different family relationships (larger families), dressed different, behaved differently.

### Catholicism, Nativism, and the First Anti Immigrant Campaigns
- **Nativism:** the idea that white-born Protestant peoples were the native interest. Antagonized immigrants as potential threats to priorities.
- 1852 flyers for the Boston Patriot, affiliated with the American Patriot Party (recalled as the Know-Nothing Party).
- Stances (all wording is original):

| In Favor Of | Opposed To |
| --- | --- |
| Protection of American Mechanics against Foreign Pauper Labor. | Papal Aggression & Roman Catholicism. |
| Foreigners having a residence in the country of 21  years before voting. | Foreigners holding office. |
| Our present Free School System. | Raising Foreign Military Companies in the United States. |
| Carrying out the laws of the State, as regards sending back Foreign Paupers and Criminals. | Nunneries and the Jesuits. |

> We are burdened with enormous taxes by foreigners. We are corrupted in the morals of our youth. We are interfered with in our government. We are forced into collisions with other nations. We are tampered with in our religion. We are injured in our labor. We are assailed in our freedom of speech.

- Religious and political themes.
- How is fear being generated and expressed politically?
- Different aspects are being racialized.
  - Not simply social or cultural difference; people thought aboout discrepnacies as racial (biological, inherent to a lineage).

#### 1844 Bible Riots
- Inn Philadelphia, 1844 Bible Riots
- Two stages of riots; spring and summer.
- Untrue rumor that the Catholics would impose teaching the Catholic bible in the school system in Philadelphia.
  - Ran through Protestant communities.
  - Working-class men attacked Catholics in the streets.
- Burned churches.
- Catholics tried to arm in self-defense; were attacked by Protestant mobs.
- Dozens of people killed in the riots.
- Led to direct conflict in the 1844 Bible riots

#### The Age of Political Cartooning
- "Mutual: Both are glad there are bars between them." *Judge* 1891.
  - Depicts Cathollics as monkeys dressed in suits.
  - The monkey is glad that it is behind bars.
  - The joke:
    - The Irish Catholic is thankful that there are bars between them because the monkey is dangerous.
    - The monkey is thankful that there are bars betwene them because the Irish Catholic is dangerous.
  - Any 19th century newspaper reader would have recognized the depiction of humans with simian (ape-like) features.
    - Depiction of an Irish person.
    - Irish Catholic and a monkey on the other.
- Features of Irish Women vs. Anglo-Saxon Women.
  - The exaggerated and simian dehumanizing characteristics were used to racialize features.
- *Puck* magazine 1889
  - "*The mortar of assimilation... and the one element that won't mix.*"
  - Depicts a female representation of America mixing a bowl of citizenship pwith the spoon of equal rights.
    - Inside the bowl are representations of the Irish with knives, yelling and screaming.
    - The rest of the portrayals of people in the bowl stay in it obediently.
  - All people ares are being racialized. 
  - The point of the comic is the one element that will not mix; highlighting irish difference. 
- Thomas Nast and *Harpers Weekly*, 1876
  - "The ignorant vote-honors are easy."
  - Displays a black person and an Irish person as equal on a scale, conspiring.
  - Thomas Nast - the most famous political cartoonist in the 19th century.
  - Displayed as ignorant and serves as a threat to democracy.

### Labor Markets, Making Race, and Immigration
- Enacted in street violence of immigrant peoples.
- Discussion of building walls around dangerous Chinese peoples who were believed not to be able to assimilate to American standards.
- Cultural and literal tropes around social differences.

#### Fragmented Whiteness 1840s-1920s
- Many races:
  - Anglo Saxon/Nordic Race
  - Celtic/Irish race
  - Hebrew/Jewish/Semitic race
  - Italian/Mediterranean race
  - Slavic/Alpine/Hunky race
- Whiteness vs. other races.
- Irish Catholics and Italians are able to claim whiteness.

#### Blumenbach and the 5 Race Theory
- Johan Friedrich Blumenbach.
- Argues for 5 race theory.
  - Caucasian
  - Mongolian
  - Malay
  - Ethopian
  - American
- Argued that Mt. Caucasus was the birthplace of humankind.
- Caucasian race spread to Europe and western Asia as far as India. Four other races emerged as less pure variations.
- Phrenology: study of skulls.
- Created an entire racial categorization around different skull types; most were imagined.
- *Pseudoscientific* discourse changed what it meant to be racial.
- Caucus mountains.
  - Blumenbach found a skull in the Caucus mountains he found was particularly well formed.
  - Believed that this was the origination of the most beautiful peoples.
  - Origination must have come from the Caucus mountains.
  - *Caucasian* use of term has carried from this 5-race theory.
  - Has little to do with real human social development and advancement.
- Racial typology began to take hold.

#### Is Race a System of Nature?
- Old science understood races as genetically distinct populations with innate characteristics including different kinds of intelligent.
- Modern science finds few genetic differences between populations and can't reliably identify boundaries between races.
- Social difference is found within social markers.
  - Conflict around social access.
  - Social hierarchy and privledge.
  - The different doesn't matter - people can sieze upon anything.
- Variety in human phenotypes falls along a gradient.
  - We cna choose to draw and redraw the meaning of races.
- Thesis: **races are socially constructed; societies draw and redraw the boundaries and change the meaning of races.**
  - Juan Gonzalez talks about the gradation of typologies in the Spanish system that led to more racial mixing.
  - Social categories of being mulatto.
  - United States; strict racial typology around being white or black.
- **Race:** A human population distinguished as a more or less distinct group by genetically transmitted physical characteristics.
- **Ethnic group:** A population that is distinguished by culture and identity.

### Whiteness
- Throughout most of American history, whiteness has been a precondition for social and political citizenship.
- Only whites could readily access full political rights.
- Only whites could feel unmarked, not different, 'normal' in American society.
- To be nonwhite was to be marked, to be different, and to struggle against barriers to full social and political citizenship.
- Aspects of culture, religion, skin color in a cauldron that is continually being shaped and re-shaped.
- In the 19th century, what makes whiteness meaningful?
  - Civil protections (voting, etc.)
  - Job protections
  - Worth fighting and killing for.
- Immigrants that challenge whiteness were met with fighting and killing.
