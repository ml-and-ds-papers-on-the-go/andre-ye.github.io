# Notes on *Recontruction & Redemption: Contested Meanings of Freedom*
Andre Ye, 12/8/20.

## Navigation

## Introduction
- Political Map of the United States, Republican Party, 1856: message that Republicans will be surrounded if slavery is not expanded.
- Care about breaking the *slave power*; did not want new federal guidelines on the question of slavery.
- The *expansion* of slavery, not slavery itself, started the Civil War.
- This week's painting: *A Visit from the Old Mistress*, Winslow Homer, 1876.
  - Shows the newfound power of the slaves, independence.
  - Reflects a tension, confusion, and an uneasiness; what is the power dynamic now?
  - The color palette reflects how *foreign* the mistress appears.
  - All women in the painting; significant and relates to the Jacqueline Jones reading from the week.
  - Thinking about the gendered difference in freedom.
- Some degree of equality, but the conditions are obviously inequal. What is the relationship between equality and inequality? - how much have things changed?
- Central questions: What caused federal reconstruction? What was the role of northern whites, freed peoples, and former slave owners? What is the role of the state? And how did formal & substantive rights play out in Reconstruction?
- Post War Questions
  - What would happen to the south, and to the newly freed people?
  - How to rebuild - why to rebuilt - a devastated south?
- Three sets of interests
  - Freed people, Northerners, and Former Slave Masters had different interests.
  - These were at once economic, social, ideological, and political.
- Compromise and contention
  - Revolution in Law and Society: 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments
  - Meaning and extent of these reforms?
- Civil War continued
  - Colfax Massacre: continuing conflict in the South
  - The 1877 Great Railroad Strike: New Conflict in the North
- Reconstructing the South; questions of how the South will be reconstructed economically (destroyed after the Civil War) and what freedom means substantively.
  - **Formal or substantive rights?** What does it mean to be free? Is it a hair above slavery or a radical change?
- *Why did Reconstruction go so poorly?*

## The End of the War
- How did the war end?
- The Civil War began as a totalizing, the first 'Modern War'.
  - War effort in which entire resources of society were mobilized to put troops in the field to continue fighting for an unprecedented loss of human life.
  - To win the war, one needed to completely destroy those sytems of production that made the war possible.
- Du Bois: the "General Strike" of enslaved peoples eroded the South's ability to produce; when the North recognized this, the war turned.
  - The North learned it could win when it embraced these slaves, turned their infastructure against the South.
  - Warred with their ability to war.
  - Destroyed harbors, bridges, railroads, plantations, etc.
- William Sherman, North General.
  - Waning days of the war; launched a devastating attack on Southern infastructure in Sherman's March to the Sea.
  - From Atlanta to Savannah, with troops fanned out in a one-mile line, destroying everything they came across.
  - Partly because of the nature of modern warfare and because of the 'arrogance' or 'stupidity' of the Southern leadership to refuse to recognize when they had lost.

## Postbellum Questions
- Post war questions; the infastructure and necessities of modern living are gone. 
- What would become of the social order of the South?
- Questions that emerged at the end of the war as the scope of what had happened in the Civil War became more clear: *how do we deal with this?*
  - The South isn't just "part of the country", was the leading economic producer in the United States up to the 1860s.
  - Major part of the US economy had been destroyed; how do we reconstitute this region as a viable economic entity?
    - A leading question.
- What does rebuilding the South/the "new South" look like?
  - Immigrants, wage workers? Should cotton be reestablished? Will it be as close to the plantation system as before?
  - Significant questions the nation attempts to grapple with.

## Wartime Reconstruction
- Differing ideas about what and how Reconstruction would look like.
- The Sea Island Experiments; islands off the Carolinas in which entire plantations were liberated.
  - Northern generals didn't want to "deal" with the population, so told slaves to cultivate the land and organize themselves.
  - Sherman issued "special field order no. 15", which guaranteed enslaved peoples parcels of land from their former owners.
  - Not compensation, but instead the ability to make a new living. 
  - Is the "Wartime Reconstruction"; generals making these types of decisions.

## Federal Reconstruction
- Wartime Reconstruction until Lincoln is assassinated in 1865 and the new president, Andrew Johnson, begins to take back those promises.
  - A tension in the South about what it means to rebuild; different sets of interests.
  - i.e. Northernors mediating between white Southernors and freedmen.
- Depicts the federal government as present neutrally, but *they had their own interests as well*.
- Sets the stage for lack of redistribution of land.
- Will wages be paid for agricultural war? Develops the period of Federal Reconstruction.
- Central institutions of Federal Reconstruction: *Freedman's Bureau*. Acted as a mediator between angry mobs of hostile whites and blacks.
- A self image of standing between the two was not entirely accurate; each had specific images.
  - Needed to fight over what the period of Reconstruction would do.
- Was tasked with establishing meaningful freedom for enslaved people.
  - A former plantation owner would come to the Freedmen's Bureau and complain; the Bureau would attempt to resolve conflicts.
  - Mediated relationships between plantation owners and freedpeoples.
  - Helped establish free peoples on some kind of independence.
- A program of land redistribution as part of the federal policy of winning the war that was taken back and wasn't given to fruition.
- Was not that it didn't spread; those parcels of land were returned to former slavemasters.

## Agenda of the Freedmen
### Family
- Freed people wanted, most importantly, was reconstituting the black family.
  - Family relationships had been destroyed and separated throughout the process of selling.
  - Very notably after the war ended: thousands of people began walking to locate their family members.
- Attempted to reconstruct those family relationships, and to reunite with lost loved ones.
- Did it similarly to what du Bois calls the "general strike": got up and left, did not wait for any federal order or for someone's permission.
  - A significant piece of what slavery meant.
- Was only one piece.

### Independent Churches
- Particularly, churches became *black institutions*.
- An extremely important aim of black freedom for former slaves.
- Nat Turner's Rebellion: saw himself as a prophet; his role was a preacher. Talked to different enslaved communities, but meanwhile was using this to organize rebellion.
  - Slave states outlawed slaves to meet even for religious purposes without a white overseer.
  - Sometimes, meant white preachers only.
  - Did not allow black people to read the Bible for themselves.
- Constructing autonomous black purposes was extremely important, and the origination of many Christian sects that become largely black in this period.
- Family emerged as an extremely important piece as well as religion.

### Schooling and Literacy
- Education was also tied to religion and especially important, given slave suppression on knowledge.
- Developing processes of literacy were essential.
- People were attempting to read; visitors to the South observed that a mechanic could not be observed without a tutorial in their backpocket.
- Everyone who was working was also trying to teach themselves how to read.
- The few members that did know taught others; it was more than just individual efforts.
- Black people organized in schools for a process of collective learning for schoolchildren.
- A few ways this was done: if there was a free black person who had access to free property or money, they coudl facilitate "Freedmen's Schools".
  - Abolitionists could give donations and funding to pay for these types of schools.
  - People from the North volunteered to go and teach in these schools to help develop literacy for freed peoples.
- The first *state* (publicly-funded) efforts are being provided in these states; the origin of a public school system as well.
  - As newly freed people are becoming citizens and voting, they began voting for education projects.
  - Freedmen's schools are also being publicly funded.
- Most of the time, children were used to ensure the economic viability of a farm.

### Civic Participation
- One of the weightiest was the ability to vote. Wasn't just family, church, education; how meaningful is freedom if you can't determine who is sitting in your government?
- Was clear very early on that freed black peoples wanted the right to vote without question.
- For a short period, were able to obtain that. Led to a transformation of Southern politics.
- 1/2 a million men vote, and elect thousands of black office-holders.
  - An extremely significant political transformation.
  - Black men are voting and holding office at every single level of government; elected from local to federal.
  - 16 black men are elected to House of Representatives.
  - 2 senators are elected to Senate.
- Widespread political efforts; voting as an extremely important part of it.

#### Land and Economic Independence
- What did it mean to be economically free? One of the biggest points of contention around what freedom meant.
- Black people want nothing to do with anything that has the resemblance of slavery.
  - i.e. having an overseers, working *for a wage*.
- Getting paid a wage to do agricultural work, or working in a gang (collective work), all reeked of slavery.
- Wanted what much of the white North had access to in the Homestead Act.
  - Wanted plots of land they could develop themselves; selling good produced on their land.
  - Return on their labor for whatever they say fit.
  - Sea Island Circular; this was being played with.

### Agenda of Southern Plantation Owners
- Masters lost the war, but did not understand or realize what losing meant.
- Were obstinate in their pursuit of maintaining claims for their "real property".
  - Argument made: we just lost, by value, the greatest assets that we had. You can't also additionally take away our property; this is a gross violation of everything the United States was founded on.
- Masters, in effect, were attempting to implement a system as close to slavery as they could possibly make it.
  - Former slavemasters came to the bureau, attempting to make slaves work.
  
## Agenda of the Northernors
### Northern Carpet-baggers
- The North recognized they could not continue with slavery; meant that some sort of compromise needed to be brokered.
- Some middle ground between these interests needed to be made.
- Northernors that occupied the federal troops, Freedmen's Bureau, Northern business agents that saw oppurtunity in the South, etc.
- Wanted to see a model like that of the North.
- Corporations, railroads, textile manufacturing; were known as "carpet-baggers".
  - Carpet-baggers refers to the Northernors as foreigners in the South.
- In terms of economic construction: black people wanted their own homestead; southern plantation owners were not willing to give up their property.
  - The North agreed.
- With wages, you have a boss, you are not seeing the fruits of your labor.

## Sharecropping as a Compromise
- An economic system is worked out; a compromise.
- Around *tenancy*; instead of redistributing land, former slaves can occupy independent homesteads they rent from their masters.
  - Pay them a yearly rent with whatever product they're able to produce.
- Was extremely predatory such that debt piled up and ended up in a endless loophole of debt.
  - Told them to go work a plot of land.
- Former slaves had no access to credit, no seed, no tools, no ways to distribute the goods, no contracts, have freedom and nothing else.
- Needed to get these things on loan; everything that was needed was lent with interest.
  - Over that year, interest was accrued; when the produce was sold, hoped that they could pay off their debt.
- Often led to a system of generational and perpetual debt.
  - Some freed peoples were able to have a good year and be able to establish themselves. A majority, however, has extreme difficulty in this system.
  - Interestingly, more whites than blacks are given for sharecropping.
- Systems of negotiating with freed peoples and attempts by slavemasters to keep them as close to slavery as possible.
  - Impacts poor whites that also face crushing debt.
  
## Federal Reconstruction
- Different sets of interests; compromises of *doing*.
- People acted to assert their interests in the most precise way.
- So long as the North was willing to remain in the South and retain those promises, they were developing that reconstruction apace.

### Radical Republicans
- Reconstruction becomes completely undone, and the next stage of the process politically.
- The economic question never gets addressed fully.
- What was the North's aim? Why did they continue to keep troops in the South throughout Reconstruction?
  - Goes back to winning the war: goal of the North not only to restore the war, but to break the slave power (redesigning federal policy in their favor only).
- Chose to enfranchise black people and to make sure that they could vote; ensure the 3/5 clause was no more.
  - If black people are voting, they're not voting for white supremacist oligarchs.
- Wanted to send federal troops into the South to ensure that black people had the right to vote.
- Impeachment of Andrew Johnson for refusing to acknowledge rights of freed black people; was from a slave state and selected as a running mate in the 1864 election.
  - Lincoln wanted to ensure the borderland states would be comfortable with his vice president's pro-slavery stance.
- Johnson attempts to allow states to re-enter the Union without any guarantees to black rights, and to give back the land to slaveowners.
  - Impeached by a series of "radical Republicans" because of their commitment to black rights.
- Thaddeus Stevens, a major figure of the Senate, able to coordinate activities of the Senate against the President to pass a series of legislative actions that sided politically with black interests in the South.

### Civil Rights Act of 1866
- Part of an understanding that Southern oligarchs could not be allmowed to reconstitute themselves.
- Reconstruction Act of 1867 is what sends troops into the South to ensure this unfolds, includes passing a Civil Rights Act of 1865 that ensures those born in the US have a series of legislatively protected rights.
- Enshrined in Constitutional amendments 13th, 14th, and 15th.
- Southern states have not been admitted to the Union yet.
- 13th banned slavery in all instances except in prisons. (ends slavery in the whole country).
- 14th was one of the most important amendments; establishes *due process and equal protection*. Becomes the centerpiece of future struggles for equality before the law in the United States for every Civil Rights struggle. Becomes a legal/formal point of struggle. Prison exception still present.
- 15th ensured voting for freed persons; made it a Constitutional right to vote if you were born in the United States and a man.
  - The first time sex is incorporated into a legal standard.

### Feminist and Abolitionist Response
- Abolitionists and women's movement: not happy about this.
- Politically, the abolitionist movement needed to negotiate with this: determine it as "halfway there" or oppose it?
- Led to a significant splintering of the abolitionist and women's rights fighting.
- Two different women's rights organization emerged: one supported the bill and another opposed it.
  - Frederick Douglass was one that supported it, argued that this was the "Negro's hour"; focusing on the racial question and looking at others later.
- Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton disagree. How can black men can be enfranchised without white women being able to vote?
  - Turned to rather racist claims. Other abolitionists support black suffrage of the fifteenth amendment.

### The First Vote and Civic Participation
- Black *men* have the right to vote, and leads to the transformation of half a million black men voting and beginning to have some sort of control.
- Have a majority in some places; pass a series of reform acts, pay for public schools, set up mental health hospitals, are a leading edge of 19th century reforms around schooling and others.

## Countervailing Forces
- As blacks are becoming more enfranchised, it's not like white supremacy disappeared, or that they understood they lost the war.
- Continued to fight in secretive paramilitary organizations that served as a military wing of the Democratic Party.
- Would attack and kill, intimidate or threaten black figures in the South; especially those that would win office.
- If you were able to win office, they could kill, lynch, drive you out of town.
- These types of terrorist organizations - KKK, Knights of Saint Crispin - had military training, usually former Confederate soldiers.
  - Formed these organizations and attempted to threaten and intimidate black people in the South.
  - Prevented economic reforms from happening.
- Escalated not only from individual lynchings and killings to whole-sale massacres.
  - Meridian massacre; 30 blacks and 1 white Republican is killed.

### Colfax Massacre and Reign of Terror
- In Colfax County, Louisiana; two different sets of black and white officials are elected.
- Attacked by a white mob, which have Civil War cannons and munition that are used to chase the community into the courthouse.
- The mob sets fire to the courthouse, drives out the people taking shelter, kills them, attacks the black community, and begins to kill black people in the rest of the county.
  - Over 100 black residents were killed.
- Rural Lousiana; no federal troops. Violence is able to stand; white electors take those positions and begin to undo things like paying for public education, or begin certifying elections in state office.
  - Have power to say that Southern Democrats will take certain seats.

### Black Codes
- A broader movement called *Redemption*.
- Attempted to 'redeem' Southern legislation from black representation.
- Able to impose more white legislatures and began to rewrite the laws, attempted to gain control of the legislature and veto/undo political reforms being implemented for black autonomy and education.
- Taxes are repealed and undone, especially ones being used to pay for public schools; public schools are removed.
- Electoral reforms on who is allowed to vote - limitations despite the 15th Amendment on who gets to vote and who gets to serve on juries.
- Could pass requirements that would allow someone to vote; e.g. you need to pay a tax (cannot pay if you don't have a tax) - poll tax.
- Literacy tests could be used to filter out black votes.
- **Grandfather clause** - meant that you could vote if your grandfather could vote. Used for voter suppression.
  - Came from Northern states in an attempt to restrict immigration.
  - Was adopted by the South.
- Contested election in Lousiana between white and black votes; widespread voting across the election in 1875 and 1876. Shooting each other to claim the state legislature.
- Because this is still a period of Reconstrution, the federal government uses troops to recognize black votes at the state level.
  - Being eroded in other states, though.

## 1877 and the End of Reconstruction
- The North is blocking some attempts but getting exhausted.
- The governor of Maine is trying to maintain presence, but Grant and the North is "tired of Southern problems".
- A decade after the Civil War has been fought; did not want to fight these issues in perpetuity.
- Not *that* committed to black enfranchisement.
- 1877: a contested election, not a clear win between the two parties. The two work out a famous compromise of 1877 towards inauguration day.
  - Rutherford B. Hayes (R) elected.
  - Democrats say that - through fraud, violence, electoral tinkering - we'll let Hayes take the Presidency if federal troops are removed from the South.
  - The Republicans said yes; Hayes takes office and removes troops from the South.

### 1877 Great Railroad Strike
- Part of the reason why he wanted to do that is because of increasing industrial violence in the North.
  - Unprecedented national strikes and riots in 1877 that paralyze the economy, cause millions of damage to railroad lines, factories, etc.
- Stationing troops in major cities of the North and attempting to stop these sorts of insurrections.
