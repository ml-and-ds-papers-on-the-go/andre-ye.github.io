# Notes on *Recontruction & Redemption: Contested Meanings of Freedom*
Andre Ye, 12/8/20.

## Navigation

## Introduction
- Political Map of the United States, Republican Party, 1856: message that Republicans will be surrounded if slavery is not expanded.
- Care about breaking the *slave power*; did not want new federal guidelines on the question of slavery.
- The *expansion* of slavery, not slavery itself, started the Civil War.
- This week's painting: *A Viit from the Old Mistress*, Winslow Homer, 1876.
  - Shows the newfound power of the slaves, independence.
  - Reflects a tension, confusion, and an uneasiness; what is the power dynamic now?
  - The color palette reflects how *foreign* the mistress appears.
- Some degree of equality, but the conditions are obviously inequal. What is the relationship between equality and inequality? - how much have things changed?
- Central questions: What caused federal reconstruction? What was the role of northern whites, freed peoples, and former slave owners? What is the role of the state? And how did formal & substantive rights play out in Reconstruction?
- Post War Questions
  - What would happen to the south, and to the newly freed people?
  - How to rebuild - why to rebuilt - a devastated south?
- Three sets of interests
  - Freed people, Northerners, and Former Slave Masters had different interests.
  - These were at once economic, social, ideological, and political.
- Compromise and contention
  - Revolution in Law and Society: 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments
  - Meaning and extent of these reforms?
- Civil War continued
  - Colfax Massacre: continuing conflict in the South
  - The 1877 Great Railroad Strike: New Conflict in the North
- Reconstructing the South; questions of how the South will be reconstructed economically (destroyed after the Civil War) and what freedom means substantively.
  - **Formal or substantive rights?** What does it mean to be free? Is it a hair above slavery or a radical change?
- *Why did Reconstruction go so poorly?*

## The End of the War
- How did the war end?
- The Civil War began as a totalizing, the first 'Modern War'.
  - War effort in which entire resources of society were mobilized to put troops in the field to continue fighting for an unprecedented loss of human life.
  - To win the war, one needed to completely destroy those sytems of production that made the war possible.
- Du Bois: the "General Strike" of enslaved peoples eroded the South's ability to produce; when the North recognized this, the war turned.
  - The North learned it could win when it embraced these slaves, turned their infastructure against the South.
  - Warred with their ability to war.
  - Destroyed harbors, bridges, railroads, plantations, etc.
- William Sherman, North General.
  - Waning days of the war; launched a devastating attack on Southern infastructure in Sherman's March to the Sea.
  - From Atlanta to Savannah, with troops fanned out in a one-mile line, destroying everything they came across.
  - Partly because of the nature of modern warfare and because of the 'arrogance' or 'stupidity' of the Southern leadership to refuse to recognize when they had lost.

## Postbellum Questions
- Post war questions; the infastructure and necessities of modern living are gone. 
- Questions that emerged at the end of the war as the scope of what had happened in the Civil War became more clear: *how do we deal with this?*
  - The South isn't just "part of the country", was the leading economic producer in the United States up to the 1860s.
  - Major part of the US economy had been destroyed; how do we reconstitute this region as a viable economic entity?
    - A leading question.
- What does rebuilding the South/the "new South" look like?
  - Immigrants, wage workers? Should cotton be reestablished? Will it be as close to the plantation system as before?
  - Significant questions the nation attempts to grapple with.

## Wartime Reconstruction
- Differing ideas about what and how Reconstruction would look like.
- The Sea Island Experiments; islands off the Carolinas in which entire plantations were liberated.
  - Northern generals didn't want to "deal" with the population, so told slaves to cultivate the land and organize themselves.
  - Sherman issued "special field order no. 15", which guaranteed enslaved peoples parcels of land from their former owners.
  - Not compensation, but instead the ability to make a new living. 
  - Is the "Wartime Reconstruction"; generals making these types of decisions.

## Federal Reconstruction
- Wartime Reconstruction until Lincoln is assassinated in 1865 and the new president, Andrew Johnson, begins to take back those promises.
- Sets the stage for lack of redistribution of land.
- Will wages be paid for agricultural war? Develops the period of Federal Reconstruction.
- Central institutions of Federal Reconstruction: *Freedman's Bureau*. Acted as a mediator between angry mobs of hostile whites and blacks.
- A self image of standing between the two was not entirely accurate; each had specific images.
  - Needed to fight over what the period of Reconstruction would do.
- Was tasked with establishing meaningful freedom for enslaved people.
  - A former plantation owner would come to the Freedmen's Bureau and complain; the Bureau would attempt to resolve conflicts.
  - Mediated relationships between plantation owners and freedpeoples.
  - Helped establish free peoples on some kind of independence.
