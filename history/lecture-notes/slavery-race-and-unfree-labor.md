- Slavery as a system of labor; the relationship between race and labor 
- Why slavery? 
- Why did racialized chattel slavery develop in the 17th Century? How did the institution of slavery change over time and why? What role did race, class, and gender play in the formation of the American slave system? 
  - Slavery, as an institution, was both material and cultural. 
    - It was a social construction to meet social interests. 
  - Slavery is defined by labor and class, as much as race. 
    - Why slavery? – exploitation and as a mindset 
    - Slavery and racism as an attempt to deal with class solidarities. 
  - Race, class, and gender: the “sociological trinity” 
    - Social construction is the process by which material and cultural factors are made and remade.

### Questions
- Why did racialized chattel slavery happen? 
- Chattel – living things that are owned as property, animals. 
- Slavery – an economic labor system and as a system of race 
- The Curious Case of Anthony Johnson: "A Negro"
  - Institution of slavery changed in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
  - 20 African peoples sold into slavery in Jamestown 
  - Identified as Antonio: A Negro 
  - Arrive in chains, given a Spanish or Portuguese name that is Anglosized.  
  - Antonio Johnson is able to obtain freedom somehow and purchase property 
  - Marries, has children, property is recognized 
  - Some of Antonio’s structures were burnt down in a fire, wasn’t able to harvest and store foods used to pay colonial government 
  - Petitioned British government for tax relief that week, took the claim to an all-white court, recognized Johnson’s hardship and granted him reprieve 
  - *This is not what you would expect the black experience in colonial America to look like.*

### Jamestown
  - Started as a commercial enterprise to develop a resource strain that could benefit the crown and enrich the throne.
  - Based endeavors on the Spanish enterprise – find people who are already rich and take their wealth to ship back 
  - Not the case with North America, arrived in 1607, no riches to plunder; many of the people had no experience as agriculturalists, new environment 
  - Many of the colonists starved; Jamestown survival rate was extremely low in the first decade (90% death rate – majority death rate continuing throughout the century). 
  - Raided indigenous food crops and villages 
  - 1622 massacre

### Tobacco
- Native to North America and unknown to Europeans 
- Grows like a weed in the Chesapeake climate 
- People looking for profitability: very profitable. Pleasant to smoke and chew, highly addictive, all over the place. 
- Ever expanding market, and it was extremely popular; saved the colony. 
- Developed agricultural foundations to export tobacco and to buy other products necessary for colonial success. 
- Harvesting tobacco is tricky: very laborious crop. Small, so to harvest lots of it you need a lot of anchorage; to make lots of profit you need to sell a lot of it, more than one farmer can produce 
- A system of labor is necessary, form the perspective of a landowner and an entrepreneur, try to take as much as possible for yourself. 
  - Tobacco needs to be harvested and processed (a very wet plant, can rot, need to be processed before they can be shipped).

### Labor 
- Enslave indigenous peoples? 
- Call on allies? Have connections outside the plantation, know the area and understand it 
- Indentured servitude and slavery, English practices before colonization 
  - Both could be used to fulfill labor 
- Indentured servitude: a labor contract. 
- Advantages of indentured servants 
  - More profitable, they can die beforehand sometimes 
  - You don’t keep them for life, less valuable 
- Problems with indentured servants 
  - Indenture is not appealing, why would people do it? 
  - Die now or becoming indentured and die later 
  - Indentured servants started to live as they became more accustomed to the harsh North American conditions. 

Immigration statistics: Colonial Immigration from 1607 to 1776

| Group | Subset | Count |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| British | Total Arriving | 472,000 |
|  | % convicts | 12% |
|  | % identured | 42% |
|  | % free | 46% |
| Africas | Total Arriving | 312,000 |
|  | % enslaved | 100%[^1] |
 
  - Majority of English people coming to the colonies were unfree, when their term ends, they want land and a payout. Colonial elites were just not paying. 
  - After a while, proposes problems for colonial elites

### Bacon’s Rebellion 
- Very angry resources, nothing to lose, enslaved peoples and indentured servants; explosive combinations. 
- 1676 Rebellion – white indentured servants, black slaves, former black slaves, former white indentured servants revolt and wanted to open up land access into indigenous territories. Wanted to sieze more land.
- Colonial government didn’t want to (Jamestown Massacre)
- Led to a clash in Virginia; revolted and overthrew the government, sacked the governor, burned the capital 
- British unit came down and put the rebellion down later 
- Nathaniel Bacon; mixed-race rebels attempting to seek access to more land. 

#### Why slavery? 
- Why turn to slavery as the exclusive system? 
- Why not increase indenture or modify the system? 
- Why not enslave whites? Enslave indentures? 
- Economics – more cost effective to purchase someone for their whole life than for a short period, because they are living longer. 
- Colonial elites were thinking about social hierarchies and ways to manage colonial societies 
- Social death 
  - Racial and class control 
  - Orlando Patterson: *Slavery and Social Death*
  - Trans-historic approach to taking about slavery, asks how do you enslave someone? 
  - Assumption: everyone is trying to get out of that institution (slavery). 
  - Patterson: you have to strip away the person’s connections in society. 
    - Remove language, family, names, social connections 
    - Thus, enslaving someone. 
  - Partially the process of what happened in the American slavery experience; something of this process must happen. 

- Egypt, Rome, etc. were founded on slavery, goods allowed the empires to thrive.
- Conquest of Americas does become racialized

### Exploring legislative beginnings 
- Color is used as a system of social control, intentionally. 
- Delineates the changes in law that happen around the 1670s and continue that create a harsh distinction between legal practices allowed for slaves and indentures vs black people and white people. 
- Slaves are identified as Negroes – black people are automatically slavery, synonymous status 
- Prevents an interracial group from running away together 
- Change the status of Baptism; no longer a standard 
- Casual killing of enslaved peoples is allowed; masters who kill their slaves cannot be tried for murder; taking away the humanity of slaves and towards chattel. 
  - Reasoning: legal standard of murder was malice; a master could not have malice because why would they destroy their own property. 
- 1680, act to prevent Negro insurrection; black people cannot carry weapons in public (swords, clubs, etc.) 
- 1682, further changes to the law, interracial relationships banned.  
- Law passed that allows any white person, regardless of property status, to use violence against any black person, will not face criminal consequences. 
- Gives every single white person a sense of mastery; inflict violence that comes with being a true master 
  -  Creates a psychological difference between what it means to be black or white 
- **Partus Sequitur Ventrem and Miscegenation**
  - Enslaved status becoming harsher 
  - Social benefits and legal incentives for being white, even if you are poor 
  - English inheritance system: patriarchal; property is given to first son of the father, passed from the name of the father. Women have no property rights, children inherit name of the father. 
  - Key transformation: Partus Sequitur Ventrem, status is derived from the mother. 
  - License for the sexual exploitation of slaves by male slave owners 
    - If you were having an affair with slaves and they had children, the male children would have a claim to your property. 
    - Prevent enslaved peoples from getting a claim to property, based on mothers. 
  - The phenotype of the child – ties the status of slavery to skin color, upending the tradition of inheritance. 
  - Sexual violence, dehumanization that comes with slavery does not have to be racialized; don’t deserve autonomy. People fight back and resist. 
    - Harsh forms of violence to maintain order.

### Transformation of Slavery from Ancient Practice to Modern Industry 
- The racialization of slavery in the new context. 
- Profitability drove racialization 
- Not just goods that can be produced from profitability 
- People can be exploited; a fundamental part of the global economy. 
- What does it mean to treat people as a commodity? 
  - Packaged and distributed like a commodity; manifest for a British slave ship 1794 
  - Fit as many people in the ship as you can; even if 10% loss of life, still profitable 
  - Middle Passage – triangle trade, England, Africa, and the Americas 
    - First leg between England and Africa, bringing weapons, gold, etc. to trade for slaves 
    - Middle passage between Africa and the Americas 
- Productivity & Labor Discipline 18th century 
  - Property ownership in terms of land and humans 
    - Property gentleman in England – aristocrat with land 
    - Property gentleman in the Americas – own lots of slaves 
  - Slavery becomes tied with profitability 
  - Slavery was transformed; slavery in different societies due to different types of conditions – eastern seaborn of Southern colonies. (1790) 
    - Only in certain places did it make sense to have chattel slavery. 
    - In the early decades, slavery confined to narrow band; Chesapeake allowed climactic conditions to be particularly strong 
- Slavery in 1860 
  - Allowed slavery to move inland and entrench in Americas 
  - 19th century industrialization; modern world slavery 
  - Slaves as property 
    - Produce on the land, determined by control of other people’s labors 
    - Slavery and not indenture 
- Liberty and Slavery 
  - Slavery works its ways into the foundations. 
    - 3/5ths compromise 
  - Cannot use the language of slavery because it was “so profoundly embarrassing” 
  - Lockean Liberalism 
    - “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” -Declaration of Independence 
    - “Life, liberty, property” in Locke's words
