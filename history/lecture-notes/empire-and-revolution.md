# Empire & Revolution: Society and Politics in Colonial America
Andre Ye, 10/20/20 & 10/22/20

## The Bottom Line
The American Revolution was political and complicated. It was not a neat story about liberty triumphing tyranny. Various interests that were in conflict and eventually got worked out in ways that were not so clean.

## Introduction
- 1783: *The Death of Major Peirson* by John Singleton Copley.
- Battle of Jersey on the island of Jersey on the channel between England and France.
  - A significant battle in the American revolution that involved no Americans.

## Central Questions
- Central Questions:
  - What caused the American Revolution?
  - What role did ideology, economics, class, empire, and race play in shaping the dynamics of the revolution?
    - Was it primarily material or ideological?
    - What type of revolution was it?
- Anti-colonial war: empire and self-determination
  - **War of independence** from colonial domination, a **civil war** between the various forces within American society, a **world war** fought both in American and in Europe.
    - A *global* anti-colonial moment.
- Civil war: revolution fractured by class, race, gender, indigeneity
  - Role of African Americans, the poor, indigenious peoples, women, and colonial elites.
- Social or political revolution?
  - The unequal political, social, economic, and ideological structure of American society remained intact after the Revolutionary War.
  - The Constitution incorporated and reflected many of these tensions.
- Relationships between indigenious and black slaves?
  - Maroonage: comes from wrecked ships and people who stake out encampments, in context of slavery - slaves would escape plantations and have nowhere to go, establish encampments.
  - Sometimes would combine with indigenious communities.
  - Seminole in Florida; adopted large numbers of escaped African slaves.
  - Mourning Wars - indigenious peoples would go to war with other nations to incorporate more people.

## Chain of De-Colonization and Destabilization
- Nations were not able to maintain heavy control over empires in the Americas.
  - French Empire collapses 1754-63
  - English Empire follows 1775-83
  - Spanish and Portuguese 1810-1825
- After strong anti-empire sentiment, colonization in the Americas largely collapses.
- Revolutions
  - 7 Years War
  - Hatian Revolution (1790)
    - Slave-led revolution, undoes political power of the French and social institution of slavery.
  - American Revolution
  - Anti-colonial revolutions in the Spanish colonies that create a series of independent countries.
- The Revolutionary War was not as unique as many theorists and historians would like to think.
- Spreads worldwide conceptions of rights.

## French and Indian War / Seven Years War - 1754-1763
- Americans: started war, Washington led a military incursion into indigenious regions allied with France
  - Sieze and speculate it
- Spiralled into a global war.
  - European War was about 7 years.
- Land and tax troubles
- 1763 proclamation
- The **French are defeated, and the English win**.
  - A phyrric victory; the English spend a vast amount of money.
  - French drop their claims; this was only partial regardless.
- England was 'overstretched' and wanted ot prevent ongoing conflict with indigenious peoples in the interior
- Launched George Washington's military career.

## Proclamation line of 1763
- Established a line that forbids English settlement beyond that line and guarantees land to indigenious peoples in the interior.
- Established by the English government unilaterally, part of peace negotiations.
- George Washington went over this line and launched the Seven Years global conflict; need to limit and restrict settlement.
  - Self-imposed, in a sense.
- The English are in debt and cannot make the colonies pay for them. Limit costs by restricting settlement.

## Political Outlook on Independence

| Date | Colonial Population |
| --- | --- |
| 1700 | 250,000 |
| 1775 | > 2,000,000 |

- 2 million people: a series of different types of people with different political interests that did not all align with Independence
- Not unilateral support for Independence. 
  - Different imperial interests.
  - Natives & indigenious peoples have their own interests
  - Slaves
  - The colonial gentry
  - Smallholders & the poorer class
  - English governmental officials
  - Women

## Colonial Possibilities - Land and Labor
- For colonial elites, there were a few ways to get rich
  - Plantation system
  - Mercantilism & trade
  - Both based on access to agricultural production, need land and labor.
- Need lots of people and lots of land to run a product.
- Middle colonies are producing wheats and other agricultural goods, Carolinas are producing rice & dyes, the economy is more diversified, but needed land and labor.

## Colonial Mercantilism
- Merchants not directly tied to the land; people who would provide capital or resources for international trade or had the network to make sales possible.
- People who were largely **in port cities in the North** (Boston and NY), but also Charleston (South).
- Relied on access to capital and networks of information.
  - Could finance the building of a ship.
  - Finance insurance.
- Distinct; more urban and more worldly.
  - Different from the plantation elite, but tied to producing goods that can get into international trade.
  - Also interested in maintaining slavery and access to land.

## Slavery and the Colonial Elite
- Your wealth derived from the slave system.
- Slave states were **by far the richest states**.
  - Richest people were slsave owners.

## Slave Population & the Stono River Rebellion
- Slaves want to be free - fundamental premise.
- Slaves in the South and the North.
  - Sojourner Truth, for example, enslaved in the North.
- Willing to fight for their freedom in a series of rebellions.
- In a sense, Bacons' Rebellion was a slave revolt.
- **Stono Rebellion of 1739**.
  - First explicit slave rebellion in the colonies.
  - Terrified the white population.
  - Slave ship brings in several dozen _newly kidnapped_ African slaves.
  - About 60 who revolt as they are being 'broken'.
    - Break a slave by getting them adjusted to what it means to be a slave.
  - Collectively revolt and kill 23 white people, burn an entire plantation down. Create a banner and write "liberty", use to march and attempt to get to the county seat.
  - Later overtaken by the Carolinan militia; killed and executed.
- **Aftermath**
  - Banning importation of slaves directly from Africa for 10 years.
  - Idea: *newly enslaved slaves were the most dangerous*.
- Sometimes, in collective/political unity for 'liberty'.

## Indigenious Peoples, Middle Ground, & Pontiac's Rebellion
- The French were defeated and lost; the indigenious allies did not give up.
- Once the French stopped fighting, the indigenious kept on fighting.
- Did not want to see English settlement continue to encroach on their territory.
- **Pontiac's Rebellion**.
  - Very understudied yet significant in indigenious history.
  - An alliance of almost all peoples in the interior on the western side of the Appalachias uniting against European settlement into the interior.
    - Whole sets of peoples agree in a political alliance to go with war against English settlement.
  - Initial uprising is very successful
    - Sieze 8 forts from English control, including Fort Detroit, as well as other significant forts
    - Forces the British, who had just established the Proclamation Line, to send *more military resources into that area*.
  - Message: don't trifle with the indigenious peoples.
- Fighting to protect their own sets of interests.

## Rural Revolt
- Rural peoples; poor whites who were also in revolt.
- 1760s and 1770s, main problem: debt.
- Farming relies very heavily on credit.
  - Spend the entire year working and producing, getting the land ready, harvesting.
  - Sell everything that you have and get all your money at once.
  - Over the course of the whole year, need credit; money to get food, supply, to get through to that point.
- Debt and credit is an important part of modern farming.
- Highly reliant on debt; markets fails and crops fail.
- **Saddled with debt from the year and no way to pay it off**.
  - Hope the next year is better, but it very well won't, and you have agglomerated more debt.
- **Courthouses will come after you**. Slaves, lifestock, property can be siezed.
  - Debt became an increasing problem for the rural poor.
- Northern speculators came to places like NH and Vermont and attempted to buy up farming land and sell it at higher prices.
  - Further indebted farmers.
- **Revolt**
  - Breaking jails
  - Rioting out judges passing sentences based on debt
  - Attacking tax collectors who could put them further into debt
- Colonial peoples had a limited degree of self-governance.
  - Could have its own legislature
  - Did not have representation in the mother country (England)
  - Had no Parliamentary representation.
  - The Crown could revoke the charter for self-governance and amend/veto sets of laws.
    - A degree, but limited degree, of governance.
  - Colonial courts largely being governed by locals.

## Urban Poverty in the Colonies
- The Urban Crucible - Gary B Nash
  - Northern cities - conflicts between urban poor and symbols of the British government or control.
- Boston Massacre, 1770.
  - Thought of as a prelude to the revolution. 
  - Colonial subjects attacking British tax collectors
  - Raiding homes of court justices and throwing material into the street and lighting them on fire.
  - British send more troops to stop the disorder.
    - Seen as tyranny.
  - Soldiers open fire in return, killed 3 people
- Rioting over the **Townshend Acts**
  - A sales tax on things everyone needs - tea, paper, etc.
  - Fairly onerous; urban poor people needed to pay significantly higher for those items.

## Enlightenment Conceptions of Liberty
> The freedom then of man, and liberty of acting according to his own will, is grounded on his having reason, which is able to instruct him in that law he is to govern himself by... -John Locke
- "Our cause is for liberty, and we are righteous and just."
- Enlightenment thinking.
  - Natural rights, the beginning of human rights
  - Gaining wide credence in all segments of societies.
- Governance; if you have reason then you have liberty and the right to governance.
- Cannot argue against the religious argument for monarchy (appointed by God); Locke suggests a different model for governance.
- Women excluded from the capability to reason.
- Demonstration of reason is in acts.
  - Self-mastery is not demonstrated by the poor.
  - If they had reason, they could reason themselves out of poverty.
- Locke introduces the standard in a restrictive sense, but it's infectious. Slaves revolt under Lockean lines.
  - Embracing while challenging Lockean liberalism.

## Social Tensions in the Colonies
> We have been told that our struggle has loosened the bonds of government everywhere; that children and apprentices were disobedient; that schools and colleges were grown turbulent; that Indians slighted their guardians, and negroes grew insolent to the masters. -*John Adams to Abigail Adams, 1776.*
- How will we put the pieces back together?

## Crisis of Authority
- There is a crisis of authority in the late colonial period. 1760s and 1770s.
- People are in revolt.
- Symbols of revolt are being challenged and graffitied and pushed back on.
- Opened armed revolt in NH and elsewhere.
- Attacking tax collectors violently (physical assault)
  - Tarring and feathering - painful, not just humilitating
- Raiding homes of colonial governors, judges, legislators, and elites

## Boston Tea Party, Lexington & Concord
- Make a series of missteps, trying to make the colonies pay for themselves.
- Cost to protect colonies was more than they were generating.
- Sales taxes that were taxing the poorest populations to further inflame the poorer.
- Tried to tax rich merchants, but people revolted and cost tens of thousands of pounds of damage and property.
  - Boston Harbor - threw all the tea into the harbor.
- Poor rural farmers begin to arm themselves and collecting caches of ammunition.
  - British who hear about it try to prevent them from getting weapons and sieze caches.
  - Are shot at as they march into the countryside.
  - British shoot back and begin killing rural farmers.
  - Political crisis hasa developed into a shooting war.

## Colonial Rebels & Lord Dunmore's Proclamation
- No longer a question of "what can we do to change this", outright military conflict.
- Lexington & Concord - a significant amount of time before the Declaration of Independence is signed & distributed.
  - Colonial governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, instantly declares this as a slaveholders' revolt with interests against the British
  - Guarantees emancipation for any slave that allied with the British.
- Many slaves joined the British.
- George Washingon doubled this proclamation.
- Enslaved and free black people remained loyal to the British.

## Women in the American Revolution
- Women played an important role in the American Revolution
- Different political alliances, but participated to the extent that they could.
- A few documented historical instances of women passing as men in order to enlist in armies to fight for one side or the other.
- Ann Bailey, able to pass as a man and saw combat before she was discovered.
- Putting on a pretense and imprisoned for it.
- Mythic stories of women fighting in battle; Molly Pitcher, which probably different happen
  - Story: so loyal to her husband that she followed him into combat; when he is killed, she leaps into action and takes his place, continues fighting.
- More common: **women would act as spies**.
  - Rebel army / British army would take over a farmhouse to do battle plans and would do it right in front of wives and daughters.
  - If women were loyal to the other side, could distribute information to whoever they wanted.
- Pushed the boundaries of women's social participation.
  - Men went to go fight, women needed to maintain the household.
  - Maintain the farm, produce, and markets.
- **Mary Wollstonecraft**
  - Articulating and producing scholarship and theory about the political participation.
  - Writing about the French Revolution and is English, English conservatives are criticizing the French Revolution by saying the Revolutionists are talking about 'rights' (unfamiliar concept). Woolstonecraft critiques the English conservatives and publishes rights.
  - Rebuts herself and changed the title from *Rights of Men* to *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman*.

## Continental Strategy in the Revolution
 - Various interests; the elite and the smallholders aligned in their interests against British colonialism.
- *Who would win the fight*?
- Strategy: survive and wait for the French.
  - Colonists had almost no chance.
  - No serious funding, access the weapons, etc.
- Serious work was being done by American diplomats in France
  - Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin
  - Negotiating weapons, alliances.
- French fleet defeats the English fleet in the Battle of Virginia Capes 1781
  - French aid and support helped Washington's army be victorious in Yorktown.

## Treaty of Paris 1783: Britain's Gift of Territory
- Treaty of Paris, British are thoroughly defeated.
- Several decades of war; struggling to maintain costs.
- Wave their hands to the North American colonies.
- All lands to the West; the British could have held onto the interior but for some reason granted the colonists the entirety of the interior.
- Result: **major defeat for indigenious peoples**.

## New Crisis for Indigenious People
- Main empires protecting their land had become wiped out.
- New onslaught for peoples in the interior
  - Ohio River Valley and further in the interior.
- 'Indian country' drastically receding from 1763 to 1810.

## New Crisis for Slaves
- Another crisis for those that allied with the British; need to flee, go to other English colonies (e.g. Bahamas, Jamaica, Nova Scotia).
- Many attempt to go back to Africa to establish new independent territories, some go to England.
- Some African Americans fought in the Continental Army.

## Articles of Confederation
- New political constitution for the United States emerges in the Articles of Confederation.
- Based on a combination of Greek Democratic practice and Haudenosaunee notions of Confederacy.
- Each state developed their own constitutions.
  - e.g. greatly indebted to France.
  - smallholders had just been at war for several years, had not been able to produce and had nothing to sell, also indebted.

## Shay's Rebellion 1786
- Major moment in post-revolutionary period.
- Daniel Shay (veteran of the Continental Army) returns to his New England farms to find that the debts are worse, the courts pursue indebtness even further than they did before, and farmers are again being thrown in jail and having their land siezed.
- Daniel Shay, along with 4000 other rural farmers in New England, revolt; continue the revolutionary struggle afterwards.
  - Just fought a revolution around this issue, yet it still persists.
- Rebellion brings George Washington out of retirement and comes to put down the rebellion.
- Leads to another political crisis for colonial elites.
- Scrapping the calls of Articles of Confederation.
  - Seek to address shortfalls of the Articles of Confederation.
- Not only emphasizing libertarian but rationale notions.
- John Randolph:
  > When I mention the Public, I mean to include the rational part of it. The ignorant vulgar are unfit... to manage the reins of government.
  - Using evidence of Shay's rebellion as a point-in-case of this.
  - If they were 'rational', they would know they needed to pay their debts.

## Framing the Constitution
- Political traditions emerging around the framing of the Constitution
- Spring of 1786, began in secret and framed as a way to address the failings of the Articles of Confederation
- Produced an entirely new political document.
- Conservative elements in this debate won out in the framing of the Constitution. A radical experiment in democracy.
- Conservative notions of democracy.
  - Institutionalizing the practice of slavery in the three-fifths clause.
  - The electoral college
  - The senate (not determined by demographic representation)
    - Implications in the Civil War
  - The federal court system (unelected, permanent judges that rule on the Constitutionality of legislation).
