Andre Ye, 10/25/2020

## Introduction
- Description of factory life in Lowell, Massachusetts, from 1832 to 1848.

## Beginnings
- 1832: Lowell was a small factory village. (page 1)
- 5 corporations were started.
  - **Robinson puts corporations in quotes.**
    - Corporations were a newly developed legal entity.
- Labor was in demand.
  - Stories of high wages were especially contagious.
  - Young girls from New England, Canada were aggregatedand delivered to factories.

## The Characterization of Women
- Lowell cotton mills: "caste of the factory girl."
  - Described as the lowest employment of a woman.
  - England and France: represented as subjected to negative influences to destroy purity and self-respect.
- Overseer: saw the factory girl as a "brute, a slave, to be beaten, pinched and pushed about."

## Descriptions of Factory Girls
- Some were not over 10 years of age, some in middle life.
  - Majority between 16 and 25.
- Young girls called "doffers".
  - "Doffed" (took off) the full bobbins in spinning frames and replaced them with empty ones.
  - Worked 15 minutes per hour.
  - Paid 2 dollars a week.
  - On duty nearly 14 hours a day.
- Working hours of all girls: 5 AM to 7 PM.
  - Two half-hour interjections for breakfast and dinner.

## A Pleasant Factory Life
- Mill girls who had hoems worked 8-10 months a year.
  - Remainder of time spent w/ family or friends.
- Some taught school during the summer months.
- No need to advance doctrine in relationship between employer and employed.
> "Help was to valuable to be ill-treated."

## Incentive to Labor - Male Education
- Secure the means of education for a male member of the family.
  - Make a *gentleman* of a brother or son.
  - Give him a college education.
- **Dominant thought in many of the "better class of mill-girls."**
  - Giving every cent of wages to her brother to get an education to enter a profession.
- Many men were helped to an education by mill-girls' wages.

## The Influence of Money on the Woman's Identity
- Prior, woman had been money saving instead o money earning.
  - Labor was a small return.
- Women had no property rights.
  - A widow could be left without her share of the family's property.
  - Father could make a will without reference to a daughter's share of inheritance.
- Law had no recognition of women as money-spenders.
  - If a woman did not marry or re-marry, had no choice but to open few employments.

## Lowell 1836 Strike
- Wages were to be cut.
- Strike
  - Mills shut down.
  - Girls went from several corporations to the grove on Chapel Hill to listen to early labor reform speeches.
- Strike did no good in practical results.
- Corporations would not come to terms.
  - Girls were tired of holding out, went back to work at reduced rate of wages.
- Set a precedent for succeeding strikes.
