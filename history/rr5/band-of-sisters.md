## Introduction
- November afternoon in 1821: land that was going to become Lowell, Massachusetts.
  - Merrimack & Concord Rivers, Pawtucket falls.
- Two Boston industrialists: **Nathan Appleton** and **Patrick Tracy Jackson**, selecting site for next textile factory.
  - Reshape the countryside, create a city.
- Lowell was *the showcase industrial city of the North*.
  - "City of spindles".
  - Women flooded into the city to take advantage of:
    - High wages and moral paternalism[^1] of corporations.
- Lowell became an industrial powerhouse.

### Broader Themes Across New England's Social Fabric
- Lowell was the footprint of the industrial revolution in the United States.
- This revolution also shaped the social fabric of New England.
- Rise of industrial capitalism:
  - Joined wage labor employment.
  - Disrupted traditional gender roles.
  - Accelerated class stratification[^2].
- **Women** negotiated changes - they were the first industrial labor force.
  - Reliance of textile corporations on female labor based on traditional gender devision of labor in textile work.
    - Employed women for the first time outside the home.

- Social horizons were broadened, cultural restraints on mobility strengthened.

### The Fight for Independence and Social Respect
- Working women of Lowell fought to create independent and socially respected role. (page 2)
- 'Factory girls' fought against gender oppression and labor exploitation.
- Women's secondary social status prevented them from acheiving economic and political rights.
  - Unable to vote.
  - Would face ostracism if they spoke.
- Levied radical critiques of the factory system.
  - Wage labor as 'wage slavery'.
  - Utilized strikes and worker organization.

### The Historical Contradiction
- Historians put feminist and labor movements in 1800-1860.
- Rarely do texts engage with class *and* feminist methods. (page 3)
- Writings about Lowell and feminism:
  - Confine scope to middle-class suffragettes.
  - Ignore rise of industrialism.
    - Stigmatizes working women.
  - Apply narrow class focus.
    - Labor focus is usually at home.
- Reagan: class and labor plays a part in feminism.
  - Marxists tried to place female workers into the workingmen movement. (page 4)
- **New trend of scholarship:** emphasizes important overlap between Marxist and feminist thought.
  > "This essay is an attempt to move in that direction." (page 4)

## Labor and the Cult of Domesticity
- Begins at page 5.
- In colonial and revolutionary eras, a woman's social status was tied to her labor.
  - Families were the unit of economic production.
  - Gender division facilitated production and accomodated farm life.
    - Men labored on staples of family income (crops),women managed and supplied the household.
  - Women's work was vital to the survival of the home.

- Gender division required mutual dependency. (page 5)
  - Trust: *kept women in respectable positions.*
- Respectability did not change second-class citizenship.
  - Independence was restrained under aspects of society.
  - Women could not:
    - Make contracts
    - Sue in cort
    - Own property
    - Make a will
    - Serve on juries
    - Vote or run for office
- Legal restrictions *have economic implications.* (page 6)
  - Married woman's wages, income, and estate are property of her husband.

### The Evolution of the Role of Women into the Public Sphere
- Women's evolution into the public sphere: industrial capitalism. (page 6)
- Commercial market expansion & proto-industrial production changed men's and women's relationships with home and work.
- More economical to purchase mass-produced cloth than to make it at home.
- **Freed up women's labor.** (page 7)

"putting out system"
: local merchant-artisans organized distribution of unfinished goods to be worked on at homes and returned to markets for sales.

- "Putting out systems" were at low piece-rate wages but gave women income to contribute.
  - A common practice. (page 7)
- Weaving raw materials: straw for hats, yarn for textiles, leather for shoes.

### Women's Role in Textile Production
- 1813: Francis Cabot Lowell began textile production in Waltham, Massachusetts.
- Employed a female workforce.
  - Used b/c of their historical role as textile laborers.
  - Cheap and exploitable supply of labo.
- Placed women's work in a modern industrial production and wage-labor relations. (page 8)

- An extremely successful operation.
  - Independent producers to wage laborers: ushered in industrial capitalism.
  - Created the 'permanent factory population'.

- Women were attracted to factory work by:
  - Relatively high wages.
  - A degree of social independence.
  - Promised protection of corporate paternalism.

### Opposition to Women in the Industrialized Workforce and the Invention of the Cult of Domesticity
- Concern raised over abused English working-class.
  - Lived in miserable conditions and minimal wages.
- Danger posed to the "women's character".
- Lamented changes of coming industrialism.
  - Household labor enshrined as a natural role for women.
  > "Women were the fairer, moral sex whose natural role was the soothe and comfort man." (page 8)
- Vision of a soothing, 'uncorrupted' woman conflicted with women entering labor relations.
  - Amplified class divisions.

- *Cult of domesticity crafted as the antithesis of a working-class creation in America.*
  - Image of 'the lady' emerged.
  - Lower-class women were ignored in the formation of values.

### Feminism and Activism
- Working women felt that they needed to defend their femininity to counteract their exclusion from domesticity.
- Female factory workers were the most radical:
  - Called for equal rights for women's participation in society and employment.
  - Recognized class-based gender oppression.
- Became organizers around labor and women's rights issues. (page 9)

- Some groups were hostile to women's radical claims of equality.
  - Workingmen framed support or opposition in patriarchal attitudes.

### The Fundamental Industrialist Goal
- How to use women's low-cost labor whilst not violating social norms about women's proper spaces? (page 10)
  - Created public spaces for women to work in, but limited civic participation.
  - Emphasized employer oversight and control.

## The Waltham System
- Women's social transformation was dependent on the transformation of labor.
- Disurptions laid the foundation for emergence of Lowell and industrial revolution.
  - 1807 Embargo Act
  - 1812 war with Great Britain
- Merchant capitalists looking to spend their money elsewhere with profitable returns.

### Setbacks and Design
- Worked with partners and investors in Boston to organize a factory system.
  - Each facet of production isolated, but integrated.
- First trial in Waltham, Massachusetts.
- Initial setbacks (page 10):
  - Financing and organizing such a large project.
    - Solved by the 'corporation' legal entity creation.
    - Lowell raised capital and established a hierarchy of authority.
  - Scarcity of labor and stigma of factory work.
    - Derived from the English working-class.
    - Turned to women's labor
- Problem: control.
  - Addressed problems of the 'putting out system'.
  - Concentration of production in one site established control.

### The Need for Female Labor
- Relied on tradition of women's textile work and low cost.
- Used not only to establish social acceptance of women in the workforce, but to establish **control**.
- Factory work had a reputation of being for those with the lowest intelligence and morals.
  - Males were generally repulsed by factory work; viewed as a loss of independence.
- Industrialists looked at marginalized labor sources to fulfill industrial demand.
- **Solution: high wages and moral regulation.**
- High wages:
  - A mill hand could earn in 1836 from 50 to 75 cents per day.
  - After a week, women could take as much as two dollars.
    - Well over other female professions but below that of average male mechanics.
  - High wages and payment in cash were a sharp turn from the putting out system.
    - Waltham system: utilizing patriarchal traditions of subordinating female labor to a male head.
    
- Corporate paternalism & moral regulations:
  - Attempted to make women's industrial work socially acceptable. (page 13)
  - Boardinghouse system pooled labor of women from isolated rural farms located all over New England.
  - Reassured New England communities that women's moral virtue would be safeguarded.
- Boarding house: protected women's morality by:
  - Locking doors at 10 PM
  - Forbidding unapproved visitors
  - Enforcing church attendance
  - Banning 'improper conduct'

### Benefits of the Boardinghouse System
- Boardinghouse system solved the two problems: scarcity and widespread public conern about the protection of moral character. (page 13)
- Also benefited employers. (page 14)
  - When one factory girl led her room into the street in a 1836 strike, the matron was fired for not controlling her.
    - Was a check on improper behavior.
  - Exercised complete control over the girls.

- Any worker who ended work had to recieve an honorable discharge to work again in the industry.
  - Company agents shared blacklist.
  - Advocating for change would place you on the blacklist.

## Industrial Women
### Visible Resistance
- 1830s and 1840s - women's labor protests engaged in explicitly public action.
- 1840s - working women of Lowell organized Female Labor Reform Association.
  - Edited newspaper.
  - Organized petition drives.
  - Spread organization to other textile factory towns.
- Protest in response to control and pay cutbacks.
  - Counter company propaganda.

- Tired of working as much as 14 hours a day in unhealthy conditions.
- Women's resistance began with private, individual actions. (page 16)

- Discharges show individual acts of challenging corporate authority.
  - Mutiny.
  - Disobedience.
  - Captiousness.

### Diminishing Corporate Returns
- Corporations saw enormous profits in first decade, but over several decades saw diminishing returns. (page 17)
- In order to continually maximize profit, increased exploitation of workers.
  - Made them more productive.
  - Cut their wages.
- 1830's women began to organize against these conditions.

### Strike Attempts
- 1834, faced a wage cut of 19%.
- Corporations preemptively fired one of the leaders.
- Women used limited organization to the best of their ability.
- Strike:
  - First day of strike: tried to rouse many working women in Lowell.
  - Second day of strike: petition circled that declared "union is power", signed by 1,200 workers who pledged not to go back until wages were restored.
- Unsuccessful strike. 1/6 of laborers in Lowell turned out, and effect on production was minimal.
- Strikers relied on moral persuasiveness and symbolic weight of absence.

<br>

- Agitation: corporations raised the cut of the boardinghouses (12.5% wage cut).
- 1836 strike; between 1/4 and 1/3 (1.5k to 2.5k) workers left.
- Women formed a temporary union.
- Successful strike; corporations rescinded fee increase.

### Political Organizations
- 1830s strikes became political organizations in 1840s.

- Petition drive 1: 1,151 signatures in Lowell & 2,139 names in state.
- Legislature responded by forming a committee to investigate working conditions.
  - Head: William Schouler, Lowell representative.
  - Deemed regulation problematic and unnecessary.
  - Misrepresented testimony.
  - Bagley attacked Schouler, calling him a corporation machine or tool.
- Schouler was voted out of office.
  - An incredible accomplishment considering women were not allowed to vote.

### Themes of Revolution Across Strikes
- Issue behind strikes and political actions not the issue of a wage reduction, but status and control.
- Lowell women & labor movement in general **relied on tradition of independence and revolt** dating back to the Revolution.
  - Locke, Wollstonecraft, Jefferson influenced thinking and behavior.
- Women defended positions as 'daughters of freemen'.
  - Directly referencing revolutionary heritage.
> As our fathers resisted unto blood the lordly avarice of the British ministry, so we, their daughters, never will wear the yoke which has been prepared for us . . . [or] yield to the wicked oppressions attempted to be imposed upon us. (page 20)
- Attempted to maintain dignity & independence of labor against corporate encroachment.

### Wage Slavery
- Working class Lowell women compared situation to slavery.
  - Loss of control of their labor.
  - Superficial resemblances.
- Long black wagons sent by corporations looked like interstate slave traders.
- Corporate hierarchy, condemned for tyranny and contradiction of libertarian and democratic principles.
- **Corporations changed the relationship of the individual to labor,** extracting control.

## Workingwomen and Workingmen
- Establishment of low wage alternative to mechanics threatened workingmen's livelihoods. (page 22)
  - Framed attacks not on corporations but on working women.

### Criticism of the Corruption of Virtuous and Moral Character
- Argued that public labor eroded women's moral and virtuous character.
- Press criticized women's work and ridiculed women's public actions.
> "The ambition of woman should be to beautify and adorn the domestic circle . . . yet how often do we see them declining to labor in a family, and preferring the quasi-slavery of a cotton factory, the last place in the world, a fashionable female academy excepted, to fit a woman for domestic society and usefulness." (page 22)
- Emphasized need to be 'protected'.
  - Condemned factory system and argued for worker control of production.
- Assumption: women's public industrial work was by nature unvirtuous. (page 22)
  - Factory work a stepping stone to prostitution.
- Illustrates patriarchal attitudes and depth of the "cult of domesticity".

### A Common Interest Hindered by Gender Prejudice
- Huldah J. Stone. (page 23)
  - Secretary of LFLRA, responsible for selling subscriptions to *Voice of Industry.
- Workingman - sympathetic to objectives of *Voice* but would not take a subscription.
- Stone generally received well in factory towns.
- Workingwomen eventually did win the support of workingmen, but came with condescending and paternalistic attidues.
  - Relationship between LFLRA and NEWA.
  - Spread quickly to Manchester FLRA and Nashua FLRA,among others.
- Leadership in LFLRA even had leadership in NEWA.
  - Bagley as vice president (not president; workingmen's organization needed a male head).
- LFLRA was admitted into NEWA as an auxiliary.
  - Lowell women were careful about presentation.

### Appealing to Patriarchal Attitudes
- Bagley: asked how girls could help workingmen in arduous battles.
  > We do not expect to enter the field as soldiers in this great warfare: but we would, like the heroines of the Revolution, be permitted to furnish the soldiers with a blanket ormreplenish their knapsacks from our pantries. We claim no exalted place in yourmdeliberations, nor do we expect to be instrumental of any great revolutions, yet we would not sit idly down and fold our hands and refuse to do the little that we may and ought to. We expect to see the revolution commenced, recorded among the revolutions of the past.
- Bagley politely downplayed women's involvement in labor.
  - NEWA struggled to gain traction b/c of debate between mechanics and 'utopian socialists'.
- **Needs of labor support superceded radical feminist ideas.**
  - Choose between class solidarity and allegiance to 'womanhood'.
  
## Corporate Feminity
- Workingmen's groups were hostile to women's full participation, but corporations were completely opposed.
- Corporations: limit women's public participation to work and not politics.
  - Created a **socially accepted place by guaranteeing to exert control.**
  - Set up a highly publicized structure of moral police.

### Living a Contradiction
- Corporations gave women a relatively high wage and provided a place to be free of immediate family obligations.
- Meanwhile, controlled their labor. (page 23)
- Contradiction:
  - Took independence from public work.
  - Pushed for further gains in social equality and political participation.
- Specifics of feminine morality and women's role in society not important to corporations.
  - As long as women remained a controllable *workforce*, all was fine.

### Corporate Redefinition of Womanhood and Feminine Morality
- Fit working women into emerging middle-class cult of *true* womanhood. (page 25)
- Emphasized women's **moral and virtuous character.**
- Sought to remove stigma attached to "factory girl".
  - Assured investors that Lowell female workers would not be corrupted and debased.
- Found a place for women outside of the domestic sphere.

### Employer Control to Resolve Contradiction
- A woman could work in public industrial labor and not violate restrictions of the domstic sphere. (page 26)
  - Contradiction solved by employer control.
- Women maintained virtuous character only through corporate invasion of privacy and rigid control.
  - Boardinghouse system and company firing practices as 2 examples of corporate control.
  - 'Moral Police' of corporations.
- When employees turned to strikes, protests, and petitions, corporations attacked them.
  - Grounds that they were *violating social role as women.*
  - **Redefined public conception of womanhood to align with corporation interests.**
- Corporations directly attacked the feminine identity.
  - Female laborers should attain the corporate definition of a feminine identity.

### The Alignment of Social Good and Corporate Interests
- Belief that idle young women were prone to depravity.
  - Corporations argued employment was a contribution to public morality.
    - It was *moral* to employ women for 12-14 hour days.
- Controlling the 'social identity and morality' of women also meant quelling strikes.
- Hence, women attacked the capitalistic structure, which promoted sexism to become profitable.

## The Factory Girl
- Recognition that gender and class oppression reinforced one another contributed to chosen identity: **factory girl**.
  - A single, cohesive, rebellious identity.
- Boardinghouses fostered close identification.
  - Close personal and working relationship led to affinity and collective action.
- Networks of sisterhood.
  - Extended kina nd social relations.
- "Factory girl" identity as a synthesis of sympathies of shared sisterhood.
  - Synthesis of "woman" and "worker".
  - Identity of solidarity and support.

### Increasing Independence
- "Factory girls" gained a level of independence unknown before.
- Mills used mostly young unmarried women.
  - Established them away from families.
  - Paid them comparatively well.
- Women independent of corporations because they were not solely reliant on them for survival. (page 30)
  - Women returned to family homesteads after a term of work.
    - Relied on family & social networks to support independence from corporations.
  
### An Intellectual Environment
- Women sneaking single pages of books into mills. (page 30)
  - Reading and committing to memory.
  - Circumventing ban of books in the factory.
- Lending libraries sprung up in mills.
- Women questioned their role in supporting slavery, religious and moral concerns, slave-like working conditions.
- Women transcended restrictions in the domestic sphere.
  - However, voices filtered through reports of men.
- *Lowell Offering* - independent. Written and edited by former factory women.
  - Heavy funding from agent limited function.
  - A step in the right direction.
  
- Mid-1840s: *Voice of Industry*.
  - Critiques against working situations in mills, social oppression.
  - Attacking separate-sphere ideologies.
    - Ideology used to limit women's social action and public participation.
  - Wage discrepancy as evidence of gender and labor oppression.

## Conclusion: Working-Class Feminism
- Sarah Bagley: war with oppression in every form. (page 32)
  - Through writings, actions, and creation of identity, women fought back. 
  - Challenged corporate control and women's exclusion from political activity.
  - Working women that controlled the *Voice* could put forward fully articulated working class feminism.

- Transformation of women's labor and socal status in early 19th century linked to rise of industrial capitalism. (page 33)
  - Corporations brought women's work into the public sphere.
  - To create a socially acceptable public work role, utilized traditions of patriarchal control.
- Corporate attempts to include women in the cult of domesticity contradicted corporate femininity ideology.
  - Working women saw and exploited this contradiction.
  - Factory women created working-class feminism.
    - Synthesized opposition to gender oppression and labor exploitation.
