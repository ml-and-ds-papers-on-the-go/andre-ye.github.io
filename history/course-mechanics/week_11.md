## Introduction
- This lesson will explore revision.
- Recall the process of developing an argument from analysis:
  1. Close reading of text
  2. Identify a WTF moment
  3. Speculate about the cause
  4. Look for evidence from other sources
  5. Construct a claim
- The revising process is perhaps one of the most important because it enables you to express intellectual work in a way that is clear.

## Revision Process
- All writing is a multi-stage process - Writing is Revising.
- Get your ideas out and shape them into something that is good.
- Writing is thinking; revising is clarifying and sharpening your thoughts.
- Revision process; reorganize, clarify, and sharpen what you are thinking so it is the best version of your paper.
- Allow yourself time to go back and revise.

## The Revision Processs
- Check the argument
- Is the conclusion better?
- Does the analysis and argument align?
  - Does the overall paper reflect your argument?
- They Say / I Say
  - Is this an argument, or are you just repeating what others are saying?
  - Can you insert something else?
- Once Over
  - Look for editing.

## The Four Criteria of Argumentation
Ensure your claim meets the four criteria of argumentation.
- Debatable: Is there a viable coutner-claim?
- Evidentiary: Is there evidence from the text?
- Explanatory: Is it an answer to a why question?
- Specific: Can I be more specific?

## Do I Say it Better in the Conclusion?
- Usually, the answer is **yes**. The intro is a jumble.
- In academic writing, give everything away right at the beginning.
  - It's hard because writing is the process of thinking; only when we write can we articulate what we think.
  - By pages three or four, we usually figure out the crux of our argument and put it only in the conclusion.
- Ensure that the introduction and the rest of the paper have the same clarity as the conclusion.

## Does the Argument and Analyis Align?
- Can be tricky; something else that happens in the process of writing is that we go in with one idea and, through analysis, move in a new direction.
- When we begin thinking about analysis, we find it may actually be something different; **modify your argument** to reflect the intellectual work done in the analysis.
- Do the two align? - does the argument have specific points from each paragraph or section of the essay worked into the claim?
  - Are you reflecting the complexity of the essay in the original claim? What is this/that paragraph about, and is it reflected in the argument?
  - Relates to the *specificity argument*.

## They Say I Say Mastery
- Identify the main question from a text, identify the main argument from another text, frame your argument as a response to others.
- A shortcut that can be used to clarify and make more convincing your argument.
- Can help with graduate students; if they are grading your work, they are looking for things like this.
- A quick check to help frmae your argument.

## Once Over
- Check for: sentence structure, paragraph cohesion, topic sentences, footnotes, and anything ghasstly.
- Are there unwieldly compound sentences? Do the paragraphs cohere?
- Can paragraphs be broken into two more cohesive ones?
- Do paragraphs have accurate topic sentences that have relationship to the claims?
- Are footnotes in order? Is anything not particularly clear?
- Avoid saying anything ghastly.
