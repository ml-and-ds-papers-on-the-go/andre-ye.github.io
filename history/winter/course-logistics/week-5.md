### Rubric for Advanced Papers
- Specific standards around *advanced* papers have criteria.
- Does it have an argument that is unique? > B range
  - Is it specific and nuanced? > A range
- What does it mean to have a sophisticated argument?
- **Argument**: some of the questions being asked when analyzing the quality of the argument.
  - Does it engage with the other arguments and ideas from reading?
    - In a somewhat simplistic way: is the quesiton rooted in a passage from another text? (B-range)
    - In a more sophisticated way: does the student's argument engage with the argument other scholars or historical persons have presented? (A-range).
  - Does it present a unique claim?
    - Is it working the material to generate intellectual contributions?
  - Does it have a nuanced understanding based on analysis and close reading?
    - Not making *blanket claims* that gloss over complications and contradictions inherent in life and social organization.
    - Not giving simplistic answers.
      - e.g. "the Civil War can be traced all to economics."
    - There is no "hard and fast" rule, but embraces the complexity of the issue.
  - Is it seeking ultimate causality?
    - Important piece of historical thinking: Diamond - proximate vs. ultimate causality.
    - Prime movers in the forces of history.
  - Does it account for alternate explanations in class or in the literature?
    - Is there a level of complexity or contradiction that has beeen introduced?
- **Organization**: how the idea is expressed relates to the content of the idea. It takes playing with and developing each time.
  - Does the paper meet standards for scholarly organization?
    - Are you producing the core of your argument early in the essay?
    - Does it meet standard scholarly organizations?
  - Is the paper organizationally consistent?
    - Does every section of the structure (paragraphs or sections) relate to immediate pieces of the claim?
    - Is background and context fully required? - sometimes, yes, but usually, no.
  - Are the ideas and analysis fully develped and logically placed.
  - Are there no extraneous, tangential, or hanging points of analysis?
    - Is there an extra shard of analysis that could be made somewhere else / doesn't belong in this paper?
    - Is it tightly constructed in this way?
  - Is the conclusion full and lead to new areas of inquiry?
    - Gives the full steps of the analysis, and pointing to new  directions.
- **Finishing**:
  - Free from excessive typos or errors?
  - Evidence that the paper has been revised.
    - Often the thesis is in the conclusion; go back and articulate it cleanly in the introduction.

### Historical Hierarchy
- In general, illegitimate hierarchy is bad.
- However, legitimate hierarchy sometimes exists.
- What types of questions are we asking?
- The past is full of different philosophical, physical, scientific, physiological, rhetorical, sociological, biological, etc. questions that can be asked.
- Trick: looking for a *hierarchy* of questions as it relates to hierarchies and social change.
- Reading responses - doing specific, close readings into many of the primary sources.
  - How is language being used?
  - Often, less rhetorical analysis, and thinking of these questions in a more historical, analytical claim.
- Distinction in historical vs rhetorical vs philosophical stakes:
  - Rhetorical and philosophical stakes are good, but not the focus of the class.
- In addition to picking the topic, we need to ask particular types of questions about it to make it historical.
- Passage in reading response or topic for culminating project: need to frame the questions historically.
