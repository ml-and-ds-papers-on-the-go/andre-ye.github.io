### Asking Historial Questions, Finding Historical Answers
- Moral, literary, etc. questions are not the focus of historical study.
- How do we take our intellectual curiosity and turn it into something historically fruitful?
- We can ask many different types of questions; for us, though, causality is important.
  - Why did something happens.
- Moving from the individual to the social.
  - Boyer and Morais: Why did John Lewis punch William Hutcheson?
  - Certain types of answers can be generated.
    - Individual or pyschological answers: Lewis was violent, mean, etc.
    - Literary answers: themes of anger and masculinity, etc.
    - Social answers: working class masculinity, violence necessary to break from the AFL, etc.
      - Further: why was violence necessary? Potential answer: legacy of violence from the Gilded Age.
  - These types of social answers are really the goal.
  - Seek a chain of questions, answers, and ultimate causality.
  - After time, the original question becomes one piece of evidence in the larger framework of claims.
- Observation > Question > Hypothesis
