# Notes on *Is History a Science?* by Eugene Goodheart

## Introduction
*page 2*
- Jared Diamond believes history is a science; believes that history has too often been one fact after another.
  - Instead, proposes "scientific history" as a search for *the ultimate explanation*.
- However, in seeking broad and ultimate explanations, Diamond  glosses over important details and smaller time frames of human history.
  - He dismisses the proximate factors in pursuit of the ultimate ones.
  - i.e. chooses geography as the all-answering solution, but in his own examples (e.g. China) other reasons, like poitics, are important.
- Science can explain normality and typicalities, but neutralizes aberrations - departures from what is thought of as normal or expected.
  > One can only speculate that exceptional or aberrant actions that may proceed from human agency are an embarrassment to the scientific enterprise, which seeks out what is recurrent, inevitable or probable.
  - What is unnormal is thought of as noise and irrelevant to broader themes and ideas.
  - Conflate these broader themes with all of history, disregarding smaller and important abnormalities.
  
- E.H. Carr's book: *What is History?* (1961). Defends history as a scientific enterprise by responding to objects in a reasoned manner.
- Responds to the following arguments that history is *not* a science. (Commentary by Goodheart in italics)

| **Objection** | **Carr's Response ** |
| --- | --- |
| History deals exclusively with the unique, science with the general. | Various scientists have experienced "the thrill of learning singular things". Historians, furthermore, constantly make generalizations, like the "causes of war". *Does not take up a more serious objection that history does not produce laws in a scientific sense.*|
| History teaches no lessons. | Historians draw lessons from the past as perspectives or guides for the present and future. *Learning from the past assumes aspects of the past will repeat themselves; this may be true, but what does it mean to "learn a lesson from history? Are these lessons scientific?* |
| History is unable to predict, and history is necessarily subjective, since man is observing himself. | History can provide general guides to future action. Furthermore, subjectivity occurs inn science too, like the principle of uncertainty in physics. *An answer lies in the definition of predictions. Historians cannot rigorously test predictions, and predict on entities that are often impenetrably subjective. Leaving out the sbjectivity in the people of past makes for a malnourished history* |

history is unable to predict; (4) history is necessarily
subjective, since man is observing himself; (5) history, unlike science,
involves issues of religion and morality
