# Notes on *Is History a Science?* by Eugene Goodheart
Andre Ye, 1/4/21

- Jared Diamond believes history is a science; believes that history has too often been one fact after another.
  - Instead, proposes "scientific history" as a search for *the ultimate explanation*.
- However, in seeking broad and ultimate explanations, Diamond  glosses over important details and smaller time frames of human history.
  - He dismisses the proximate factors in pursuit of the ultimate ones.
  - i.e. chooses geography as the all-answering solution, but in his own examples (e.g. China) other reasons, like poitics, are important.
- Science can explain normality and typicalities, but neutralizes aberrations - departures from what is thought of as normal or expected.
  > One can only speculate that exceptional or aberrant actions that may proceed from human agency are an embarrassment to the scientific enterprise, which seeks out what is recurrent, inevitable or probable.
  - What is unnormal is thought of as noise and irrelevant to broader themes and ideas.
  - Conflate these broader themes with all of history, disregarding smaller and important abnormalities.
  
- E.H. Carr's book: *What is History?* (1961). Defends history as a scientific enterprise by responding to objects in a reasoned manner.
- Responds to the following arguments that history is *not* a science. (Commentary by Goodheart in italics)

| **Objection** | **Carr's Response ** |
| --- | --- |
| History deals exclusively with the unique, science with the general. | Various scientists have experienced "the thrill of learning singular things". Historians, furthermore, constantly make generalizations, like the "causes of war". *Does not take up a more serious objection that history does not produce laws in a scientific sense.*|
| History teaches no lessons. | Historians draw lessons from the past as perspectives or guides for the present and future. *Learning from the past assumes aspects of the past will repeat themselves; this may be true, but what does it mean to "learn a lesson from history? Are these lessons scientific?* |
| History is unable to predict, and history is necessarily subjective, since man is observing himself. | History can provide general guides to future action. Furthermore, subjectivity occurs inn science too, like the principle of uncertainty in physics. *An answer lies in the definition of predictions. Historians cannot rigorously test predictions, and predict on entities that are often impenetrably subjective. Leaving out the sbjectivity in the people of past makes for a malnourished history.* |

- Those that agree that history is scientific choose not to give much space to the actions of *individuals*. It's easier to quantify social forces than individual actions.
  - View individuals as a product of history, rather than history a product of individuals.
  - Is history simply an exclusive product of social forces?
  - Is there individual agency?
- A strictly scientific view of history subscribes to inevitability and determinism, which ignores freedom of will.
  - Is history predictable?
  - Determinism is a problematic concept.
- Establishing true causation is not simple.
- A scientific view of history also suffers from reductionism; the sheer complexity of history, with its unpredictability an unrigorous testing capability, cannot be described with a set of scientific laws.
  - A historian must reason out what did not occur to identify what did occur; this is of course incredibly subject to biases and subjectivity.
- Scientists and rationalists favor reason over tradition, "hope for the future" over "reverance for the past".
  - Belief in Science and Reason does not necessarily guarantee impartiality and objectivity.
- *scientism* - an ideology that promotes the idea that science should define *all* disciplines.
  - Science continues to exert and validate its immense power.
- We would *like* to preserve the idea of objective knowledge for historical studies.

<br>

- Bottom line: *there are scientific tools the historian has, but fundamentally the historian's purpose to tell what happened - objectively so - may or may not be generalized or a law.*
  - Historical representation cannot is not always a science.
  - History does not look for one explanation to triump over all other ones.
