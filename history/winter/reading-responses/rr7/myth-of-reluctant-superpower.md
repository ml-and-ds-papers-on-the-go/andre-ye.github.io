### Introduction
- Events culminating in an onward thrust of 1898 and a dramatic emergence on the world stage.
- *Greatness was not sough, it happened*. American policy was a response to external factors.
  - 1898, Americans chose war only when depredations of Spain in Cuba were intolerable.
  - 1914, U.S. remained neutral, intervening only when Germany violated U.S. neutrality rights.
  - 1939, Americans stayed on the sidelines until provoked by Japan's Pearl Harbor attack.
- The myth of the "reluctant superpower" - Americans asserting themselves only under duress - reigns as a master narrative for explaining and justifying exercise of global power.
- The reluctant superpower trope curbs inclination to reconsider purposes of America's unquestioned global dominance.
- The foreign policy elite fundamentally share this common vision and conform in practice to this strategic consensus.

### Early Challenges to the Reluctant Superpower Myth
- Two occasions: critics mounted a challenge to the reluctant superpower consensus.
  1. Decade leading up to World War II;
  2. Crisis centered on the Vietnam War.
- Dissenters subjected the myth to sustained assault.
  - Rejected premise that America's foreign policies was a function of external developments.
  - Instead, they argued that these polices **derived from influences closer to home**.
- These dissenters formulated their alternative to the myth.
  - Dissenters appeared during the Cold War were oblivious to the defects of communism, just as they had discounted Hitler's threat.
  - Prone to **astigmatism** - blind to inconvenient facts.
- These dissenters called into attention a *different set* of inconvenient facts.
  - Yielded insights into origins, motives, and conduct of U.S. foreign policy.
- Proponents of dissenters: Charles A. Beard and William Appleman Williams.

### Charles A. Beard [add more]
- Charles A. Beard was the most influential historian in America; he was original in interpretation, politically progressive, and prolific.
- However, Beard's reputation stood as a ruin in the landscape of Americna historiography; Beard found himself denounced as a fascist apologist.
- Beard closed his career by denouncing the orthodox account of U.S. entry into WWII.
  - Accused Franklin Roosevelt of deception in his conduct of foregin affairs.

> “I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.” 
> - FDR

- This promise for third term was not kept; even as FDR was promising to keep the country out of war, he was conniving to maneuver the U.S. into it.
  - Some instances of Roosevelt's dishonesty - notably in misrepresenting U.S. naval involvement in GB's battle against U-boat threats.
- Such an attack by Beard was impermissible; he consigned himself to the status of a miscreant.
- Beard was stirred by social ills of his era - by-products of laissez faire attitudes of American industrialism.
- How had such a society come into existence?
  - Beard's first book scandalized patriotic defenders of historical orthodoxy.
  - Argued that Framers pursued their task less under the high ideals of 1776 than on capitalist profit.

> "The Constitution was essentially an economic document based upon the concept that the fundamental rights of property are anterior to government and morally beyond the reach of popular majorities."
> - Beard

- The Civil War for Beard was a pivotal event in U.S. history - resolving competition between Jeffersonian ideals of agrarianism and Hamiltonian visions of capitalism.
  - Beard argued this "second Revolution" was not a dispute over slavery, but a contest between two economic systems pushing to expand.
  - The real winners were the industrialists of the North, it was argued.
- Beard regulated foreign policy as an afterthought in this time; foreign policy was derived from *domestic policy*.
- American participation in WWI alerted Beard to hazards of commercial diplomacy.
  - Was WWI a war of German aggression that threatened the survival of democracy?
  - Revisionists challenged the notion that the U.S. had truly remained neutral during 1914-1917.
    - Bankers and arms merchants engaged with a massive trade in arms with the Allies; they would lose significant profit if GB and France lost the war.
    - By 1917, the U.S. government became complicit in Allied schemes.
- Beard found this case persuasive; he concluded in 1930 that U.S. entry into the war had been a mistake.
  - He found U.S. policies now more sinister and complex.
- He proposed **American leaders chose intervention abroad to avoid difficult questions at home.**
  - Japan's incursion into Manchuria and Hitler's power in Germany suggested a president seeking to dodge the need for structural change at home.
- Beard's interpretation of American statecraft derived from two maxims:
  1. Foreign and domestic policy were parts of the same thing.
  2. Nations are governed by their interests as their statesmen concieve these interests.
- Advocates in Washington had concluded that the domestic market alone could not satisfy the nation's requirements; a surplus needed to be exported.
- The essence of statecraft was the long stretches between war; this was when issues that really counted were addressed.
  - U.S. foreign policy as an either/or proposition: a question of commercial expansion or stagnation and decay.
  - Exporting economic surpluses ("industrialist way of escape") constituted the national interest.
- Not only a matter of making money, but preserving long-standing arrangements of power and priviledge.
- Only by opening the world to American trade and investment could the U.S. flourish and ensure the permanence of existing domestic order.
