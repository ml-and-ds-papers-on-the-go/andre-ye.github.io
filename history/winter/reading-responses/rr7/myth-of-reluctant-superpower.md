### Introduction
- Events culminating in an onward thrust of 1898 and a dramatic emergence on the world stage.
- *Greatness was not sough, it happened*. American policy was a response to external factors.
  - 1898, Americans chose war only when depredations of Spain in Cuba were intolerable.
  - 1914, U.S. remained neutral, intervening only when Germany violated U.S. neutrality rights.
  - 1939, Americans stayed on the sidelines until provoked by Japan's Pearl Harbor attack.
- The myth of the "reluctant superpower" - Americans asserting themselves only under duress - reigns as a master narrative for explaining and justifying exercise of global power.
- The reluctant superpower trope curbs inclination to reconsider purposes of America's unquestioned global dominance.
- The foreign policy elite fundamentally share this common vision and conform in practice to this strategic consensus.

### Early Challenges to the Reluctant Superpower Myth
- Two occasions: critics mounted a challenge to the reluctant superpower consensus.
  1. Decade leading up to World War II;
  2. Crisis centered on the Vietnam War.
- Dissenters subjected the myth to sustained assault.
  - Rejected premise that America's foreign policies was a function of external developments.
  - Instead, they argued that these polices **derived from influences closer to home**.
- These dissenters formulated their alternative to the myth.
  - Dissenters appeared during the Cold War were oblivious to the defects of communism, just as they had discounted Hitler's threat.
  - Prone to **astigmatism** - blind to inconvenient facts.
- These dissenters called into attention a *different set* of inconvenient facts.
  - Yielded insights into origins, motives, and conduct of U.S. foreign policy.
- Proponents of dissenters: Charles A. Beard and William Appleman Williams.

### The Rise and Fall of Charles A. Beard
- Charles A. Beard was the most influential historian in America; he was original in interpretation, politically progressive, and prolific.
- However, Beard's reputation stood as a ruin in the landscape of Americna historiography; Beard found himself denounced as a fascist apologist.
- Beard closed his career by denouncing the orthodox account of U.S. entry into WWII.
  - Accused Franklin Roosevelt of deception in his conduct of foregin affairs.

> “I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.” 
> - FDR

- This promise for third term was not kept; even as FDR was promising to keep the country out of war, he was conniving to maneuver the U.S. into it.
  - Some instances of Roosevelt's dishonesty - notably in misrepresenting U.S. naval involvement in GB's battle against U-boat threats.
- Such an attack by Beard was impermissible; he consigned himself to the status of a miscreant.

#### Beginnings of Economic-Root Ideas
- Beard was stirred by social ills of his era - by-products of laissez faire attitudes of American industrialism.
- How had such a society come into existence?
  - Beard's first book scandalized patriotic defenders of historical orthodoxy.
  - Argued that Framers pursued their task less under the high ideals of 1776 than on capitalist profit.

> "The Constitution was essentially an economic document based upon the concept that the fundamental rights of property are anterior to government and morally beyond the reach of popular majorities."
> - Beard

- The Civil War for Beard was a pivotal event in U.S. history - resolving competition between Jeffersonian ideals of agrarianism and Hamiltonian visions of capitalism.
  - Beard argued this "second Revolution" was not a dispute over slavery, but a contest between two economic systems pushing to expand.
  - The real winners were the industrialists of the North, it was argued.
- Beard regulated foreign policy as an afterthought in this time; foreign policy was derived from *domestic policy*.
- American participation in WWI alerted Beard to hazards of commercial diplomacy.
  - Was WWI a war of German aggression that threatened the survival of democracy?
  - Revisionists challenged the notion that the U.S. had truly remained neutral during 1914-1917.
    - Bankers and arms merchants engaged with a massive trade in arms with the Allies; they would lose significant profit if GB and France lost the war.
    - By 1917, the U.S. government became complicit in Allied schemes.
- Beard found this case persuasive; he concluded in 1930 that U.S. entry into the war had been a mistake.
  - He found U.S. policies now more sinister and complex.
- He proposed **American leaders chose intervention abroad to avoid difficult questions at home.**
  - Japan's incursion into Manchuria and Hitler's power in Germany suggested a president seeking to dodge the need for structural change at home.
- Beard's interpretation of American statecraft derived from two maxims:
  1. Foreign and domestic policy were parts of the same thing.
  2. Nations are governed by their interests as their statesmen concieve these interests.
- Advocates in Washington had concluded that the domestic market alone could not satisfy the nation's requirements; a surplus needed to be exported.
- The essence of statecraft was the long stretches between war; this was when issues that really counted were addressed.
  - U.S. foreign policy as an either/or proposition: a question of commercial expansion or stagnation and decay.
  - Exporting economic surpluses ("industrialist way of escape") constituted the national interest.
- Not only a matter of making money, but preserving long-standing arrangements of power and priviledge.
- Only by opening the world to American trade and investment could the U.S. flourish and ensure the permanence of existing domestic order, so the argument went.
- Beard viewed moral and humanitarian arguments on behalf of internationalism as camoflauge.
  - American boundaries contained enough human tragedy and misfortune.
- Beard proposed the U.S. emphasize self-reliance and economic self-sufficiency - maximizing American freedom of action.
- At the end of FDR's term, Beard realized the New Deal was a salvage operation; FDR was intent on preserving democratic capitalism.

#### Five Faults of Economic Expansion
1. Dreams of endless economic expansion are illusory.
2. The more insistently the U.S. pressed to open the world, the greater the opposition it would encounter.
3. In provoking resistance, the door to militarism at home would be opened and the U.S. would find itself increasingly resorting to force.
4. American political culture and the composition of American society are ill-suited to an expansionist strategy.
  - Divided ethnically and religiously, celebrating individual liberty and self-gratification.
  - Lack deference to authority.
5. Preoccupation with opening doors misconstrued the U.S.'s true interests.
  - A commitment to providing all Americans with a decent standard of living.
  - To pursue the nation's material well-being by venturing beyond the frame of national security was to court collapse and exhaustion.
  - America's own internal market was underveloped and vast.

#### Complex Characterization and Disgrace in World War II
- Looming crises in Europe and Asia were portrayed primarily in moral terms leading up to WWII.
- No victim was completely without fault and no great power was innocent.

> “...greed, lust and ambition in Europe and Asia do not seem to be confined to Italy, Germany and Japan, nor does good seem to be monopolized by Great Britain, France and Russia."
> - Beard

- Ambiguity shrouded motivations and actions of states, including those of the Untied States.
- Beard warned Americans of seeing international politics as the handiwork of nefarious individuals. Americans possessed the power to prevent the nation from sliding into collapse.
- Beard sensed that FDR was becoming "intoxicated by moral exuberance"; denied that foreign quarrels had a moral basis.
- Beard placed himself at the forefront of a grassroots movement opposing U.S. internvention in the war.
  - Even as German military successes edged closer to American involvement, Beard insisted that flaws within the American system of political economy determined U.S. policy.
- After Pearl Harbor, brooding and embittered, Beard constructed his "devil theory" to explain American intervention - FDR as Satan.
  - Beard charged FDR with dishonesty, deception, and hijacking the Constitution.
  - Critics lambasted Beard's books on U.S. entry to WWII as tendentious and mean-spirited.
- On Hitler, Roosevelt had been right - Beard's 1940 prescription for U.S. policy would have resulted in disaster.
- While Beard missed one truth, he hit upon others.
