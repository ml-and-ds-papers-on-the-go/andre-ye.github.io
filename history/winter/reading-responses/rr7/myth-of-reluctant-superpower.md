### Introduction
- Events culminating in an onward thrust of 1898 and a dramatic emergence on the world stage.
- Prevailing idea: *Greatness was not sought, it happened*. American policy was a response to external factors.
  - 1898, Americans chose war only when depredations of Spain in Cuba were intolerable.
  - 1914, U.S. remained neutral, intervening only when Germany violated U.S. neutrality rights.
  - 1939, Americans stayed on the sidelines until provoked by Japan's Pearl Harbor attack.
- The myth of the "reluctant superpower" - Americans asserting themselves only under duress - reigns as a master narrative for explaining and justifying the exercise of global power.
- The reluctant superpower trope curbs inclination to reconsider purposes of America's unquestioned global dominance.
- The foreign policy elite fundamentally share this common vision and conform in practice to this strategic consensus.

### Early Challenges to the Reluctant Superpower Myth
- Two occasions: critics mounted a challenge to the reluctant superpower consensus.
  1. Decade leading up to World War II;
  2. Crisis centered on the Vietnam War.
- Dissenters subjected the myth to a sustained assault.
  - Rejected premise that America's foreign policies were a function of external developments.
  - Instead, they argued that these policies **derived from influences closer to home**.
- These dissenters formulated their alternative to the myth.
  - Dissenters who appeared during the Cold War were oblivious to the defects of communism, just as they had discounted Hitler's threat.
  - Prone to **astigmatism** - blind to inconvenient facts.
- These dissenters called into attention a *different set* of inconvenient facts.
  - Yielded insights into origins, motives, and conduct of U.S. foreign policy.
- Proponents of dissenters: Charles A. Beard and William Appleman Williams.

### The Rise and Fall of Charles A. Beard
- Charles A. Beard was the most influential historian in America; he was original in interpretation, politically progressive, and prolific.
- However, Beard's reputation stood as a ruin in the landscape of American historiography; Beard found himself denounced as a fascist apologist.
- Beard closed his career by denouncing the orthodox account of U.S. entry into WWII.
  - Accused Franklin Roosevelt of deception in his conduct of foreign affairs.

> “I have said this before, but I shall say it again and again and again: Your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars.” 
> - FDR

- This promise for the third term was not kept; even as FDR was promising to keep the country out of the war, he was conniving to maneuver the U.S. into it.
  - Some instances of Roosevelt's dishonesty - notably in misrepresenting U.S. naval involvement in GB's battle against U-boat threats.
- Such an attack by Beard was impermissible; he consigned himself to the status of a miscreant.

#### Beginnings of Economic-Root Ideas
- Beard was stirred by social ills of his era - by-products of laissez-faire attitudes of American industrialism.
- How had such a society come into existence?
  - Beard's first book scandalized patriotic defenders of historical orthodoxy.
  - Argued that Framers pursued their task less under the high ideals of 1776 than on capitalist profit.

> "The Constitution was essentially an economic document based upon the concept that the fundamental rights of property are anterior to government and morally beyond the reach of popular majorities."
> - Beard

- The Civil War for Beard was a pivotal event in U.S. history - resolving competition between Jeffersonian ideals of agrarianism and Hamiltonian visions of capitalism.
  - Beard argued this "second Revolution" was not a dispute over slavery, but a contest between two economic systems pushing to expand.
  - The real winners were the industrialists of the North, it was argued.
- Beard regulated foreign policy as an afterthought at this time; the foreign policy was derived from *domestic policy*.
- American participation in WWI alerted Beard to hazards of commercial diplomacy.
  - Was WWI a war of German aggression that threatened the survival of democracy?
  - Revisionists challenged the notion that the U.S. had truly remained neutral during 1914-1917.
    - Bankers and arms merchants engaged with a massive trade in arms with the Allies; they would lose significant profit if GB and France lost the war.
    - By 1917, the U.S. government became complicit in Allied schemes.
- Beard found this case persuasive; he concluded in 1930 that U.S. entry into the war had been a mistake.
  - He found U.S. policies now more sinister and complex.
- He proposed **American leaders chose intervention abroad to avoid difficult questions at home.**
  - Japan's incursion into Manchuria and Hitler's power in Germany suggested a president seeking to dodge the need for structural change at home.
- Beard's interpretation of American statecraft derived from two maxims:
  1. Foreign and domestic policy were parts of the same thing.
  2. Nations are governed by their interests as their statesmen conceive these interests.
- Advocates in Washington had concluded that the domestic market alone could not satisfy the nation's requirements; a surplus needed to be exported.
- The essence of statecraft was the long stretches between war; this was when issues that counted were addressed.
  - U.S. foreign policy as an either/or proposition: a question of commercial expansion or stagnation and decay.
  - Exporting economic surpluses ("industrialist way of escape") constituted the national interest.
- Not only a matter of making money but preserving long-standing arrangements of power and privilege.
- Only by opening the world to American trade and investment could the U.S. flourish and ensure the permanence of existing domestic order, so the argument went.
- Beard viewed moral and humanitarian arguments on behalf of internationalism as camouflage.
  - American boundaries contained enough human tragedy and misfortune.
- Beard proposed the U.S. emphasize self-reliance and economic self-sufficiency - maximizing American freedom of action.
- At the end of FDR's term, Beard realized the New Deal was a salvage operation; FDR was intent on preserving democratic capitalism.

#### Five Faults of Economic Expansion
1. Dreams of endless economic expansion are illusory.
2. The more insistently the U.S. pressed to open the world, the greater the opposition it would encounter.
3. In provoking resistance, the door to militarism at home would be opened and the U.S. would find itself increasingly resorting to force.
4. American political culture and the composition of American society are ill-suited to an expansionist strategy.
  - Divided ethnically and religiously, celebrating individual liberty and self-gratification.
  - Lack of deference to authority.
5. Preoccupation with opening doors misconstrued the U.S.'s true interests.
  - A commitment to providing all Americans with a decent standard of living.
  - To pursue the nation's material well-being by venturing beyond the frame of national security was to court collapse and exhaustion.
  - America's internal market was undeveloped and vast.

#### Complex Characterization and Disgrace in World War II
- Looming crises in Europe and Asia were portrayed primarily in moral terms leading up to WWII.
- No victim was complete without fault and no great power was innocent.

> “...greed, lust and ambition in Europe and Asia do not seem to be confined to Italy, Germany, and Japan, nor does good seem to be monopolized by Great Britain, France, and Russia."
> - Beard

- Ambiguity shrouded motivations and actions of states, including those of the United States.
- Beard warned Americans of seeing international politics as the handiwork of nefarious individuals. Americans possessed the power to prevent the nation from sliding into collapse.
- Beard sensed that FDR was becoming "intoxicated by moral exuberance"; denied that foreign quarrels had a moral basis.
- Beard placed himself at the forefront of a grassroots movement opposing U.S. intervention in the war.
  - Even as German military successes edged closer to American involvement, Beard insisted that flaws within the American system of political economy determined U.S. policy.
- After Pearl Harbor, brooding and embittered, Beard constructed his "devil theory" to explain American intervention - FDR as Satan.
  - Beard charged FDR with dishonesty, deception, and hijacking the Constitution.
  - Critics lambasted Beard's books on U.S. entry to WWII as tendentious and mean-spirited.
- On Hitler, Roosevelt had been right - Beard's 1940 prescription for U.S. policy would have resulted in disaster.
- While Beard missed one truth, he hit upon others.

### William Appleman Williams
- William Appleman Williams was a midwesterner; his father was killed when he was 8.
- 1947, Williams left the Navy to study history @ the University of Wisconsin - famous for loyalty to the teachings of Charles Beard.
- Heavy progressivism at the University of Wisconsin completed his transformation into a radical.
- Williams' first book, *American-Russian Relations, 1781-1947*, questioned orthodox views on the Cold War's origins.
- Williams was politically one of the most controversial historians.
- Founding father for the Wisconsin School of revisionist history that examined the underside of U.S. foreign policy.
- On-campus, he was a wildly popular teacher; he gained access to notable opinion journals.
- Williams increasingly found himself out of sympathy for Vietnam-era radicals
  - Considered counterculture to be childish and self-indulgent, the sexual revolution repugnant.
- 1968, Williams fled Madison for the Pacific coast; his final years were largely reclusive.
- Williams acknowledged his debt to Beard at a time when Beard's professional reputation was at rock bottom.
  - Beard's ideas provided the foundation for William's ideas.
  
#### Expansionism and Openness
- Williams endorsed Beard's view that expansionism was integral to American history.
  - Expression of a struggle for America's soul - not whether citizens should be agrarians or merchants, but instead whether Americans would descend into materialism or a Christian commonwealth.
- Americans could give themselves over to hedonistic individualism or accept demands and self-discipline of living with others in a responsible, humane fashion.
- A "charming but ruthless faith in infinite progress fueled by endless growth" became central to the American way of life.
- The United States pursued expansion abroad in a way that reflected particular American interests and values.
  - American leaders abandoned efforts to colonialize because it wasn't profitable.
  - Anti-imperial sympathies were at odds with U.S. soldiers subduing alien populations.
  - What mattered was not ownership but commercial success.
- "Open Door imperialism" - a highly innovative strategy developed by American leaders.
  - Open Door Notes declared America's interest in preserving China's territorial integrity; claiming for the U.S. to enjoy the same privileges as by Europeans and Japan.
  - Underlying this appeal for fairness was a chance that Americans would reap more than their fair share of benefits.
- Americans embraced the Open Door policy because it encompassed ideals of economic opportunity, political liberty, and security.
- Openness was not simply a cover for exploitation - most imperialists believed an American empire would be humanitarian.
- Dogma of openness became a central component of American ideology.

#### World War II
- Williams wrote that the war's end left Americans confident that their earlier visions of Manifest Destiny were materializing.
- Orthodox view: Joseph Stalin entertained aspirations of his own - the Soviet dictator marked himself as ungratefully and dangerous.
  - William rejected this, instead proposing Soviet behavior was defensive in nature, and that the U.S. more than the Soviet Union was bent on exploiting victory to expand its influence.
- This version of the Cold War's origin ignored the character of the Soviet regime - abuse of human rights, denial of freedom, mass starvation.
- The events of the 1960s - assassinations, Vietnam, etc. - transformed Williams.
  - His critiques seemed not only provocative but true.
- Beard attempted to legitimize a revisionist perspective on the origins of WWII - and destroyed his reputation.
  - Williams' challenge to Cold War orthodoxy became both fashionable and influential.
- New revisionists threatened internationalist consensus and popular support for the crusade against communism.
- Williams wanted Americans to create democratic socialism.
  - Even for this radicalism, his solutions reflected a deep-seated conservatism.
  - As improbable as Beard's plea to ignore Nazi Germany.
- Eventually, Williams advocated for national dismemberment of the U.S. into communities.
  - By the end of 1970, the New Left failed to develop a coherent program and sunk into irrelevance.
- Williams' concerns sounded progressively more preposterous near his death.

> "The issue is the nature and dynamic of the American empire, not the validity of Lenin’s thesis."
> - Williams

#### Four Worthy Points from Williams' Efforts to Understand American Power
- From Williams' efforts to understand American power, there are four worthy points.
1. The United States came to play a role in the 20th century that must be understood as a variant of the empire.
2. The idea of something coming into existence out of American control was rejected; American imperialism arose out of a particular worldview and reflected a coherent strategy with the support of the American people.
3. Unearthed assumptions underlying liberal internationalism, explained its logic, identified its purposes, and divined its implications. The aim was to open the world to American enterprise.
4. In practice, the only sure way to guarantee openness is through the exercise of the dominant power.
- Beard first identified the underlying logic of American expansionism, and Williams went one step further in urging Americans to contemplate implications of such expansionism.
