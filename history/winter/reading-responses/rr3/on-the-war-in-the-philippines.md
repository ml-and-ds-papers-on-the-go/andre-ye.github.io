# Context
The year was 1900, and the United States was engaged in a controversial war to
gain control of the Philippine Islands. Many Americans opposed this first
attempt by the U.S. government to exercise imperial control over another
country. After visiting the Philippines, Senator Albert J. Beveridge (1862–1927)
delivered this speech on the Senate floor. In it, he strongly urged the president
and his fellow senators to embrace imperialism.

# Introduction
- The Philippines are territory Constitutionally belonging to the United States.
- Beyond the Philippines are China's markets, which would be a shame to throw away.
	> We will not renounce our part in the
mission of our race, trustee under God, of the civilization of the world.
- When this task is presented, "we" will not howl regretfully like slaves but instead be grateful for a task worthy of our strength.

# Trade Links to China
- The Philippines are "the last land left in all the oceans", and it would be an irreversible mistake to abandom it.
- Asia will be the largest trade partner with America; the Pacific belongs to her.
- Europe will begin to become dependent on American exports; where shall America turn?
- China is "our natural customer".
	- Closer to the United States than to England, Germany, or Russia.
	- The Philippines are a door to Eastern markets.
	- The US has had less than 9% of China's massive commerce; instead, the US ought to have at least 50%.
- Navigation lines from mports converge at the Philippines.
- As the Pacific becomes the ocean of commerce, the power of the Pacific will be the power of the world.
- Germany, Russia, Spain, and Japan are rapidly expanding their trade with China; why not the United States?

# Strategic Military Placement
- The Philippines are in a convenient place as a "fortress" in the Pacific to defend the Western coast.
- It is a base for military and naval operations.
- From this position, the United States can strike any enemy.

<br>

# Natural Resources and Wealth of the Land
- The fertility of the land in the Philippines is unsurpassed.
	- Various exotic and lush products grow in the tropical zones.
	- Philippine wood can supply furniture.
	- The  mountains are full of coal.
 	- The rivers are full of gold.
- The markets these will yield great profits to whoever can export the resources.

# Oposition to War as its Prolongment
- American opposition to the war has been the primary factor in prolonging it.
- The Philippine War is like the -Revolutionary War.

<br>

# The Barbarism of Filipino People
- The Filipinos are a "barbarous race" that have been modified through contact with a "decadent race".
- Filipinos are superstitious, dishonest, disorderly, and corrupt.
- Few in the Philippines are capable of Anglo-Saxon self-government, or even to comprehend it.
	- Referred to as "children".
- The Filipinos are not capable of self-government, instructed by Spaniards.
- The Declaration of Independence applies only to people *capable* of self-government.
	- It is a *prostitution* to express these rights to Filipinos.
	- If the Declaration applies to all men, why is it denied to American Indians?

### God's Call for Imperialism
- God has not been preparing Anglo-Saxons to stand idle; he has instead marked the American people to lead the regeneration of the world.
- He has delegated this as the *divine mission* of America.
- America serves as the trustee of the world's progress and guardians of righteous peace.
> The judgment of the Master is upon us: “Ye have been faithful over a few things; I will make you rule over many things.”
