# Lewis H. Douglass Opposition to McKinley
- President William McKinley promised Flipinos under American sovereignty would not be governed as slaves, because a government of liberty would be ruling over them.
- Douglass argues McKinley is blind to racial prejudice in the United States and in soldiers overseas.
- Black American soldiers are despised by the South, which the McKinley administration has "accept[ed] dictation" and cater to.
	- The administration lacks the courage to deal with Americans withot regard for race.
- Whatever the United States government controls, dark races face injustice - Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Manila.
- **How can promises be made to Filipinos thousands of miles away when the administration does not protect black Americans at home?**
	- It is sickening hypocrisy to argue killing Filipinos is for the purpose of good government.
- The United States can expand when it learns justice should be blind to race and color.

# "The Negro Should Not Enter the Army", Missionary Department of the Atlanta, Georgia, A.M.E. Church
- The ministers of the A.M.E. church - progressive and enlightened - should tell black young men to stay out of the United States army.
	> "If it is a white man's government, and we grant it is, let him take care of it. The Negro has no flag to defend."
- If black people have no civil, social, political, judicial, or existing rights, they should not further the institution that guarantees the very absence of those rights.
- President McKinley and the nation, be it explicitly or through silence, *celebrate* - or at the very least, *tolerate* - the abuse of black people.
- Black soldiers were mistreated regardless of what they did solely because they were black.
- What is there to be gained for the black soldier?
- The flag is a symbol of liberty to the white man (and he is justified in being proud of it), but a worthless rag for the black man.
- A minister that encurages enlistment int he army preaches murder of innocent blood for nothing.
- Furthermore, most white people do not *want* colored soldiers in the army either.
