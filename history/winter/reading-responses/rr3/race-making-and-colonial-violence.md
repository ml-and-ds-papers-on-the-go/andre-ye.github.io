#### Introduction
- Theodore Roosevelt placed colonial violence at the heart of America: Roosevelt justified the ongoing colonial war in the Philippines by casting it as a race war.
- The war was often rationalized in racial terms, and soldiers knew Filipinos in racial terms.
- These racial ideologies were not simply reflexive projections from the US; instead, race helped organize and justify U.S. colonial violence.
- Filipino campaigns for civilizational recognition *before* the Americans (w/ the Spanish) shaped U.S. racial ideology and Filipino nationalism.
- Racial ideologies were dual with war strategies and tactics.

#### Questions of Recognition
- By 1898, Filipino elites engaged in a struggle against Spanish racism - a key element of Spanish colonialism - for two decades.
	- Spanish political and racial ideologies advocated for Catholicism, greater education, etc.; Filipinos used these to argue for greater rights.
- U.S. troops took Manila following the Battle of Manila Bay. This introduced a 6-month period "battle for recognition".
	- U.S. soldiers found themselves in an inticing and strange Filipino urban world.
	- Filipinos were unsure of the invading army's status; wary but eager for business.
- Colliding interests, failed translations, suspicions, and jurisdiction doubts boiled into animosity and conflict.
- Filipinos were commonly characterized as filthy, diseased, and evil in business dealing.
- White soldiers began to treat the colored people like black peoplef rom the United States - robbing them, cursing them, assaulting them.
- U.S. soldiers, neverthelesscame to know individual Filipinos and their families; American soldiers frequented Filipino concerts, dances, etc.
- Filipinos initially viewed U.S. soldiers as *liberating them* from Spanish rule.

```
We're thankful that the City's ours, and floats the Stars and Stripes;
 We're thankful that our cause is one that from these Islands wipes
 The degenerate oppressors of a brother human kin
 Who now—beneath "Old Glory"—a nation's place may win.
```

- Treaty of Paris in late-1898 between Spain and the U.S.
	- Filipinos launched legal and historical arguments for the sovereignty of the Philippine republic and the illegitimatimacy of transferring it from Spaint o the United States.
	- U.S. formal recognition of the Philippine Republic was argued to have been established already, and that Spain had no legal right to cede Philippine territory to the U.S.
- The Philippine Republic sought recognition of its sovereignty as a civilization, capable of self-governance and "modern" government.
	- Two naval officers were on an inland expedition of Luzon; the Filipino government did not give them passports but two *presidentes* that guided them.
	- The two officers were given elaborate balls and operas, but also percieved cold suspicion. There was tremendous variability.
	- Hope was fading that freedom from Spain meant freedom of government; suspicion and hostility increased.
- Americans had a reputation for racial oppression; there was an impression that the Americans were looking for "new slaves".
	- The Filipinos would rather die fighting than to be the subject of this new pruported racial conquest.
- President McKinley had initially argued only for acquiring coal mines and naval bases but had been persuaded for the entire nation.
	- Filipinos were excluded from treaty negotiations.
	- McKinley was concerned about Filipino recognition fo U.S. sovereignty.
- Military commanders of the U.S. were to announce the Americans had come as friends, not as invaders or conquerers.
	- This proclamation, however, was a formal derecognition of the Philippine Republic; it reeked of benevolence and suggested questionable assimilation methods.

# Race-Making and Colonial Warfare
- Outbreak of the war occured in early February of 1899.
- Filipino sokesmen revealed a preoccupation with promoting Filipino civilization.
	- Anti-Imperialist newspapers argued that the Filipinos has excelled in education, literacy, art, and political & religious leadership.
	- The struggle was also painted as antiracial.

### Anti-Imperialist Socieites
- The war had been challenged from the start by anti-imperialist societies and organized into the Anti-Imperialist Leage (nov. 1898).
- The party leaned towards independents and reformers, bringing together conservative and white-supremacist Democrats and liberal Republicans.
	- Criticized the U.S. invasion as unjust.
- Many anti-imperialist claims focused on the negative consequences of empire for the United States itself; many of these concerns were explicitly racial; i.e. corruption of the body politic through Filipino citizenship.
- Other anti-imperialists recognized the Philippine Republic.

### Countering Anti-Imperialists with Racialized Arguments
- McKinley appointed "Philippine Commissions". Served two purposes:
	- Served as a crux for the War Department's "policy of attraction" - drawing elites away from the Republic.
	- Produce an authoritative document of events to justify U.S. aggression.
- Rationalizing the war led to racial formation; Americans and Filipinos were racialized in new ways.
- The U.S. population was racialized as "Anglo-Saxons", and overseas conquests were legitimated by ties with the British Empire.
	- Opponents of war argued that Philippine annexation would be a departure from exceptional moral and political foundations.
		- Supported with claims of racial essence.
- The Philippine-American War was seen to be a natural outgrowth of Western conquest. Unlike other races, Anglo-Saxon Americans "liberated".
	- Rudyard Kipling: "The White Man's Burden". Casats Americans as a race with an inevitable imperialist destiny.
- Filipinos were "tribalized".
	- Social evolutional theory held that societies moved from tribes to a unified nation; if one could identify tribes, a nation did not exist.
	- Tribalizing the Phillipines would dismantle the recognition of the archipegalo as a Republic.
	- Philippine Commission played a heavy role in this; identified three "sharply distinct races" - the Negrito, the Indonesian, and the Malayan.
	- The Philippines were argued not to be a nation but a sparse assemblage of different tribes and peoples.
	- The commission often misrepresented statistics; yet nevertheless these were passed down and held as fact.
- Even as the administration tribalized Filipinos, U.S. soldiers racialized their opponents; this is exemplified by terminilogical shifts (i.e. "Indians", "n------", "black rascals/devils", "Gugos", "savages").
	- A tremendous *transformation* in language.
- Some journalists and soldiers argued this to be an inevitable surfacing of long-present racial tensions.

# Racializing Guerrilla Warfare
- General Arthur MacArthur reported that there was no *organized* insurgent force to strike at; Filipino tactics had shifted dramatically towards guerrilla warfare.
- In these new settings, tropical disease, impassable roads, and unfamiliar conditions would weaken American advance; the guerrilla swould have geogrpahic knowledge and village-level support.
- U.S. Army General Otis similar decentralized his forces to match the Filipino army.
- Geurrilla warfare held different meanings for Filipino & American troops.
	- *Filipinio officers* were schooled in conventional warfare and guerrilla warfarew as unfamilair. They took inspiration from anticolonial guerrilla struggles elsewhere.
		- Alguinado may have delayed adopting geurrilla tactics because of concerns about expressions of "civilization".
		- Geurrilla warfare meant scattered organization, thus playing into the trop oef a "savage".
		- Nevertheless, guerrilla war was international politics.
	- *Americans* found the geurrilla war to be new and disturbing; it meant dispensing gallant rushes at the enemy amd rethinking strategy.
		- Differentiating friendly villagers from Filipino soldiers was a dangerous task.
- The end of conventional war and the dispersal of the Philippine army meant Filipino resistance was "criminal" and "uncivilized", in the eyes of the Americans.
	- Filipino response: strong nations make use of force to impose claims on weaker ones; the fight that offers equal risks ot both combatants are more noble and worthy of men.
	- In reality, the Filipinos had really been left with no choice.
- Geurrilla war was tactical rather than ethnological; the Filipinos risked nevertheless the pain of being called "uncivilized".
	- Races were characterized by how they waged war in the colonial world.
- General MacArthur concluded that the massive Filipino participation and support for guerrilla war was neither rational nor political, but from *ethnological homogeneity*.
- U.S. soldiers increasingly defined the entire Filipino population as the enemy; the task of the U.S. army was said to "persuade" Filipinos not to accept U.S. sovereignty.
	- However, this was argued to be very difficult when "ethnological homogeneity" governed over reason. The unitedness of Filipinos as a "race" placed it outside of "civilized" warfare.
- Racial terms were employed in accounts of shooting Filipino prisoners, often under the guise of "escape".
	- Racial terms were also levied against civilians.
	- Soldiers referred to war as *hunting*, a brutal manisfestation of racial exterminism.

# Race and Atrocity
- Race was made to defend the means, undermining moral and legal claims against American soldiers accused of "severities".
- U.S. Army defenders held that abuses were rare, and were swiftly punished.
- Three variants of racial arguments.
	1. *Filipino guerrilla war was a "savage war" outside moral and legal standards of "civilized war".* Filipino combat was depicted to be a "race" was against whites; and thus racial exterminism by whites seemed inevitable.
	2. *"Civilized" men may adopt "savage" methods to defeat savages, but they can do so without surrending their civilization.* This allow American atrocities to be explained in a way that distances them from U.S. initiative.
	3. *Final declarations of the end of the war; McKinley and Roosevelt repeatedly attempted to bring the war to an end in 6 occasions.* Filipino resistance to Americna authority was characterized as "banditry", not "insurrection".
- Americans developed a racial formation that would reorient the U.S. towards an imperial pathway.
- Filipino revolutionaries attempted to achieve American recognnition through their "civilization", or even their fighting. The two processes of combat and race-making became entangled.
- Colonial violence would continue to haunt both the United States and the Phillipines.
