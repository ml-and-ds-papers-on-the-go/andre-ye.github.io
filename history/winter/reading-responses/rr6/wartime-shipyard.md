### Women in the Shipyard
- Before the war, most heavy industries provided a few areas where feminism did not work out.
- The work was thought to be so complex and arduous it would never be able ot be handled by women.
- Women were beginning to intrude into the work of construction by late spring 1942, later into shipbuilding.
-Women were put into open sheds so "everybody could keep an eye on them".
- Limitations upon the usefulness of women were more withdrawn; by spring of 1943 women had become a stable factor of the wartime shipyard.
  - Women were ~20% of the total working force.
- Most men were courteous or even gallant; male and female workers would engage in casual chat.
  - Underneath the formality and politeness was a resentment of women as rivals of men in a man's world.
- Masculine antagonism constituted a vague atmosphere.
  - Often manifested on shipyard talk and behavior of the sexual role of women.
  - Mix of man's anxiety of a woman touching his possessions.
  - The only contribution a woman was said to offer was a disturbance and a distraction.
- Sex was an avocational interest of the male worker; the sexual role of women was especially emphasized.
  - Evoked biological distinctions between men and women, reinforcing social demarcation lines.
  - Traditions about division of labor were linked to biological function.
- Rumor was constantly spraead; result was to deny the establishment of buisnesslike relationships between men adnw omen.
- Sexually interpreted distrust of women as shipyard workers reached a climax amid fall of 1942 on Moore Dry Dock.
  - Employment of women was becoming an established policy.
  - Would "unprincipled girls" "steal" married men? - some argued so.
- Management issued strict governing rules around the dress of women.
  - Even the women formed an undeputized agency for enforcement of rules about dress.
- It was not unusual for working-class women to respond to pressure of economic necessity but supplementing the family income through "casual and ill-paid labor".
- The greater the shipyard worker's economic security, the more determined he became to be *the* pillar of his family's financial support.
  - A woman working at home was to be evidence of her husband's earning capacity.
