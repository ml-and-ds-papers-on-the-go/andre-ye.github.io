### Women in the Shipyard
- Before the war, most heavy industries provided a few areas where feminism did not work out.
- The work was thought to be so complex and arduous it would never be able to be handled by women.
- Women were beginning to intrude into the work of construction by late spring 1942, later into shipbuilding.
-Women were put in to open sheds so "everybody could keep an eye on them".
- Limitations upon the usefulness of women were more withdrawn; by spring of 1943 women had become a stable factor of the wartime shipyard.
  - Women were ~20% of the total working force.
- Most men were courteous or even gallant; male and female workers would engage in casual chat.
  - Underneath the formality and politeness was resentment of women as rivals of men in a man's world.
- Masculine antagonism constituted a vague atmosphere.
  - Often manifested on shipyard talk and behavior of the sexual role of women.
  - Mix of man's anxiety of a woman touching his possessions.
  - The only contribution a woman was said to offer was a disturbance and a distraction.
- Sex was an avocational interest of the male worker; the sexual role of women was especially emphasized.
  - Evoked biological distinctions between men and women, reinforcing social demarcation lines.
  - Traditions about the division of labor were linked to biological function.
- Rumor was constantly spread; the result was to deny the establishment of businesslike relationships between men and women.
- Sexually interpreted distrust of women as shipyard workers reached a climax amid the fall of 1942 on Moore Dry Dock.
  - Employment of women was becoming an established policy.
  - Would "unprincipled girls" "steal" married men? - some argued so.
- Management issued strict governing rules around the dress of women.
  - Even the women formed an undeputized agency for enforcement of rules about dress.
- It was not unusual for working-class women to respond to the pressure of economic necessity but supplementing the family income through "casual and ill-paid labor".
- The greater the shipyard worker's economic security, the more determined he became to be *the* pillar of his family's financial support.
  - A woman working at home was to be evidence of her husband's earning capacity.
- Tradition and masculine egotism took part in the resistance.
  - Fear of women as competitors in a monopoly of men.
- Craft unions attempted to protect their exclusiveness; restrictions were eventually broken through.
  - There was a heavy demand for welders; the first women hired to work at Moore Dry Dock were welders.
  - Reluctance of unions to permit full participation by women - an attempt to protect an interest from being shared.
- Common explanation - the work was unsuitable for women.
  - Men seldom credited women with the capacity of desire to put in an honest day of work.
- Women nonetheless received a man's full pay for doing "less than" a man's work.
- Women's right to good working conditions was also attacked as unjust.
  - Women were to have played no role in the organized effort.
  - A woman would prove to be a source of weakness.
- Women faced discriminatory difficulties in advancing their status.
  - Women at the Dry Dock did not pass beyond being a journeyman.
- Further difficulties awaited women given authority over shipyard men.
- In the winter of 1943, female electricians had a pay reduction; disproportionate quitting and layoffs of women were clear from shipyard statistics.
  - By February 1945: women constituted less than 10%.
- Some women in the shipyards justified masculine rumor and insult.
- The work attitudes of many women did not meet the standards of the craftsman.
  - Women had the little impulse to delve into the secrets of their craft or to work harder than necessary.
  - A byproduct of looking upon the work as temporary.
  - Few women disrupted the masculine claim of their inferiority.
- Many women were antagonistic to ideas that implied equality of economic opportunity.
  - This attitude was more readily accepted because shipyard labor was not very attractive in terms of personal development or expression.
- However, despite their reluctance and the derision that surrounded them, thousands of women came to work.
- Some men had come to believe that women had a permanent place in certain phases of heavy industry, like being electricians.
- The labor of shipyard women was sorely needed.
  - Counselors were even added to encourage women to enter the shipyards and to remain effective workers.
  - A short-lived women's council was even formed; an orientation program was also set up.
- Cultural media also played a role: Rosie the Riveter was established as a heroine, for instance.
  - Some more liberal unions encouraged active participation by women in union affairs.
- As the shipyard community declined the size and approached normality, women remained a minority group.
- Citizenship of women continued to be conditional and their status falls short of complete equality with men.
- The conventional alignment of the two sexes was shaken in the shipyard situation, but it is not evidence that the principles of unity established in this period were enough to withstand traditional distinctions.

### Okies
- Immigration from foreign shores was the largest source of growth in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
- Most of California's immigrants were non-Californian.
- Industrial and agricultural interests welcomed waves of migration, but the stranger was nonetheless disdained.
- Barriers of distrust and discrimination were likewise raised against Americans and whites whose origins were in a less favored area.
- The Depression: a migratory movement to California occurred; drought had dealt the final blow to many people already weakened by financial chaos.
- These migrants were loosely called "Okies".
- Okies came to California at a time when protective impulses of the economy were at their high.
- California's traditional exclusiveness became an active antagonism.
- This group of migrants existed throughout the first few difficult years and remained in California.
  - Over time, Okies became more integrated into the agricultural centers they settled in.
- As war approached, there were too few willing hands to keep California's industry alive.
- Labor-seeking immigrants were now welcomed and sought-after.
  - Agencies throughout the country recruited workmen for shipyards and aircraft factories, etc.
  - Nearly 1.5m people were drawn to California between 1940 and 1943 for its war industries.
- At least 20% of the workers in the Bay Area shipyards were Okies.
- The Okie had peculiarities that set him apart - his dialect, dress, and customs were undeniably different.
  - Various charges were made: Okies were too extravagant, or their impoverished background was ridiculed.
- Antagonism to shipyard Okies dwelt within the structure of the jealous guarding a vested interest.
  - Like women, Okies were assumed to know little or nothing of the techniques of the industry.
- **Racialization of Okies** - pg. 46. "a different kind of face... more dumb-looking, somehow."
- Others complained that Okies were reaping the excellent wages and working conditions for which they did not fight.
  - Newcomers - especially Okies - were said to be the source of eventual union collapse.
  - Okies were often the main targets of resentment.
- Okies were less schooled as a group; remarkable examples of lack of opportunity.
- Many Okies were not illiterate; they had worked in Southwestern towns, oil fields, and industrialized cities.
  - Discrimination against Okies was seldom practiced if their knowledge warranted it.
- Vagueness of boundaries of Okie habitats made "Okie" a very general epithet.
- Okies adjusted easily and became much less readily identifiable.
  - Implicitly, Okies were determined to remain permanently on the Pacific Coast.
  - Consciously chose to stay and accept limitations of income and opportunity that may confront them postwar.
- Okies were aware of the attacks against them, but developed counterattacks, or were quick to show that the popular concept of an Okie did not apply.
- The Okies were the latest addition to the population of a state that had grown since repeated waves of immigration.
- Antagonism to Okies was one that eventually ceased to be of public concern.
