- August 23rd: the day the Tennessee legislature enacts the Federal suffrage amendment.
  > Now at last we can begin.
- In fighting for the right to vote, most wommen had been quiet in other respects; now they could struggle for *freedom*.
- The problem of women's freedom: how women can exercise "infinitely varied gifts in infinitely varied ways", and not confined to one route.
- Although women will never be truly free until they achieve some emotional freedom, conditions of outwards freedom like economic status can aid in helping women doing so.
  - The organized feminist movement should concern itself around these outward conditions.
- **Concerning freedom of choice** in occupation and economic independence:
  1. *Break down remianing barriers* (e.g. legal) that make it difficult for women to enter or succeed in the workforce.
  2. Institute a revolution in *training and education of boys and girls*; it must be womanly and manly.
- How shall man be changed such that he shares work and responsibility in the household?
  - A problem of education.
    > "we must bring up feminist sons."
- *Voluntary motherhood* is primary in the support for a woman's individual economic independence.
  - Birth control is as important as equal pay.
- *Motherhood endowment* should be given to keep mothers free; if raising children is a service to society, they should be entitled to adequate economic reward.

> It will be time enough then to consider whether she has a soul.
