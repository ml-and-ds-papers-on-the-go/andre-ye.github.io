### Context
> Hull House, Chicago’s famed “settlement house,” was designed to uplift urban populations. Here, Addams explains why she believes reformers must “add the social function to democracy.” As Addams explained, Hull House “was opened on the theory that the dependence of classes on each other is reciprocal.”

- America is pledged to the democratic ideal, but it has been partial.
- Democracy has not established itself in social affairs
- The gift of freedom was given to slaves, but nevertheless they are ostracized; the immigrant is enfranchised but hurled with epithets.
- Because of lack of democracy in social affairs, our consciences are becoming "*tender*".
- Many people living in the largest districts of great cities are in abject poverty, and nothing has been done to remedy this.
- They share no tradition and social energy, and make for no progress.
- Cultivated and educated people that stay away from a certain portion of the population use this very justification to continue staying away.
- The educated young people have been shut off from common labor; they chase theories but never pursue action.
- If a democratic country does not allow anything to be achieved except through "masses of the people", a higher political life will be impossible to crave.
  - The blessings in which a life of refinement and cultivation bring can be made universal.
- Young people possess a desire for action, and to right wrong; yet they have no outlet for their faculties.
  - They feel the need to put theory into action.
- The Settlement is an experimental effort to aid solving social and industrial problems caused by modern conditions of life.
