### Introduction: "Progressives and the Problem of Class"
- Jane Addams amid the Pullman car shopworkers' strike of 1894: torn between sympathy for strikers and a desire to bridge class divisions.
  - Addams met with striking employees and listened to their grievances, as well as the managers.
  - Class war began to loom on the horizon.
- Jane Addams came in an era of profound labor conflict.
- The "Class Problem" was the preoccupation of the generation.
  - Looked unflinchingly at social inequity around them, and hoped to overcome barriers to individual opportunity.
- The reform movement was not to be working towards one kind or class of people, but instead for the common good.

#### Historical Debate Around the Progressive Movement
- The Progressive movement has been elusive for historians; there are many theories:
  - Progressives were viewed as members of a displaced middle class, driven to reform by anxiety over their status.
  - Progressives were argued to have advocated for the corporate ideal, promising social stability, while protecting the interests of large businesses.
  - Reformers were seen as a middle class that promised efficiency, professional expertise, and bureaucratic solutions to society's big problems.
- Shifting tides of interpretation made the Progressive movement seem too naive and vague.
- Stromquist argues **the Progressive movement formed itself as a response to escalating social tensions in the late 19th-century**, most clearly demonstrated by labor-capital battles.
- This movement drew inspiration from older traditions of reform.
  - Legacy of abolitionist campaigns against chattel slavery;
  - Social democratic movements in Europe.
- The Progressive movement was created by a new generation.
- A "meliorist" wing of the movement was dominant.
- A vigorous and smaller group identified themselves with a class partisan perspective associated with socialist or syndicalist tendencies.
- Between these groups lay several reformers whose ideology overlapped these two wings.

#### Rhetoric of the Progressive Movement
- A new language of reform emerged.
- It distanced itself from republicanism or nationalist Americanism, but instead used terms like "the people".
- The "rhetoric of the moral whole"[^1] promised restoration of the common good as a social ideal.
- Enemies were corrupting influences (e.g. corporate "robber barons") that threatened democratic institutions and economic opportunity.
- This new speech was popular among reformers and politicians.
- A political middle ground to speak for *"the public"* was seized by the Progressives.
- The language of class was banned from the vocabulary of Progressive reform.
  - Progressives promoted that social differences based on structural inequality could be corrected through enlightened social policy.
  - Focused on the individual and attacked environments that limited individual opportunity.
- Neither individuals nor the government should, in the view of the Progressives, alter social power and property.
  - Progressives lay the foundation for 20th-century liberals in restricting a worldview formed by class.
  
#### The Progressive Movement in the Face of Postbellum Industrialism
- "The sovereignty of the people" was a "dynamic fiction" in republican thought, Edmund Morgan argues.
- Elimination of property qualifications for white males made citizenship classless, but still excluded African Americans, immigrants, and women.
- Postbellum "free labor ideology" promised universal access to opportunity in the frontier.
- As the industrial revolution advanced, working-class republican critiques of individualism gained support.
  - If poverty, economic oppression, and denial of citizenship were applied to a large portion of the population, the claims of republican citizenship lost much meaning.
- **Alternative strand of progressivism** - a class-partisan perspective that found much support in labor and socialist parties.
  - Was committed to a radical vision of "industrial democracy".
- Progressive reformers near the end of the 19th century, though, saw this dispossessed class "reclaiming the wealth it had created" as *dangerous*, not virtuous.
  - This was in opposition to its more radical movement in the 1880s and 1890s.
- These reformers embraced the idea that industrial progress would produce prosperity and alleviate misery.
- Massive immigration initiated by the "second industrial revolution" prompted early 20th-century reformers to work hard in producing an enlightened populous.

#### Progressive Unwillingness to Accept Class and the Ideal of Social Harmony
- Placing importance on new educational techniques and settlement houses, Progressives insisted on socially responsible behavior of capital.
- The reform movement hoped to rationalize production and to reengineer a more socially productive society.
- Purged of corrupting influences, democratic politics could be used to build social solidarity and community responsibility.
- Progressive reforms did not accept a word demarcated by classes; this shaped their approach towards reform.
- Settlement houses were largely populated by nonwhites and immigrants and generally stood outside of "the people".
- Political reforms intended to protect the democratic process would ensure a democratically inclined polity capable of putting social good over personal interest.
- Progressive Democrats (like John Dewey) imagined a society of citizens whose equality was guaranteed by their active participation in the democratic process.
- In the short run, *Progressive reform narrowed rather than expanded the circle of citizenship*.
  - Most Progressives regarded most immigrants and African Americans as unprepared to join the political community of voters.
- Unwillingness to acknowledge class divisions were rampant in the Progressive movement.
  - Embraced *classless social harmony*.

#### Dynamics and Influences on Progressive Reform
- **A broad group of reformers often gathered at critical moments despite their differences in support of progressivism.**
  - Reformers reaffirmed the Progressive movement when many gathered to support the NAACP[^2].
  > In the five years before the outbreak of the world war... our general efforts were more and more interrelated with many other movements. -Jane Addams
  - These movements affirmed the reality of a Progressive movement.
- **Popular insurgency inside the Progressive movement itself influenced it.**.
  - Conflict periodically occasionally rose to the surface and created realignments that reshaped the terrain of the reform community.
  - Class war in coalfields, the Triangle shirtwaist fire, etc.; the "moral whole" shattered periodically.
  - These events and consequences were mostly absorbed by the movement as it generated new directions to take initiatives.
  - Meanwhile, another more radical movement determined to realign labor and capital in new ways grew stronger.
- The core Progressive movement may have lost its initial coherence, but it retained its identity.
- Progressive historians have often lost sight of the core vision amid a torrent of reform activity.

#### Cultural Limitations to a Universal Promise
- The Progressive movement carried middle-class and native-born working-class cultural conceptions from where it began.
  - It drew heavily on a maternalist reform agenda.
  - Its visions of "the people" were limited and culturally bounded.
- New immigrants and African Americans were often brushed to the sides; they merited charitable attention only.
- When ethnic or race leaders advocated on their own behalf, many reformers viewed them as dangerous.
- As class conflict erupted repeatedly, reformers' confidence in the ability to sustain a movement of class reconciliation and industrial peace was heavily shaken.

#### Modern Progressivism Amidst War and the Great Depression
- Progressivist reformers assembled fractured legions to take on a new national mission for democracy.
  - Found the campaign for democratic reform absorbed into the wartime agenda of a broad patriotic coalition.
  - This coalition included many of their corporate enemies.
- The socialist movement was increasingly isolated because of its opposition to the war; it would only return until the Great Depression.
- Progressivism figured into the equations of reform in ambiguous ways.
- The New Deal bolstered confidence in state-orchestrated solutions to economic and social dislocation.
- The Progressive tradition had generally run its course by the end of the 1960s, but these reforms left a legacy.
  - "Protean" liberals continue to generally deny class matters in American society.
- Most American liberals of the late 20th century continue to believe problems of poverty, corruption, and the environment **lay in cross-class coalitions acting in broad public interest**.
  - Class-constituted power and political mobilization around class was denied.
- Liberal reformers of the Progressive Era have constructed a discourse and set of social policies they hoped would allow American society to get past its "class problem".

### Conclusion: War and the Ragged Edges of Reform
- The roots of 20th-century liberalism ("new liberalism") lay in its critique and abandonment of classical liberalism.
  - Classical liberalism's faults lay in its excessive deference to *individual liberty* and faith in the natural justice of the marketplace.
- Many reformers believed that such principles were bankrupt in the face of deeper social crises.
- Progressivism took shape from industrialism and class warfare.
  - Reformers sought to find a new social balance.
  - Placed great faith in the capacity of a democratic community to shape a future of social harmony.
    - Community provides a check on rampant individualism.
  - Progressives found the state a useful ally for civic action and community improvement, but it was no substitute for civic activism of "the people".
- Progressives envisioned the amelioration of class conflict; nevertheless they held unsavory racial views.
  - Only the slow processes of social uplift and education could bring racial "others" into the circle of full citizenship.
  
*The Emergence of Class Warfare in Opposition to Progressivist Ideology*
- 1915: a precarious point in Progressive history.
- Class warfare was re-emerging in an increasingly polarized society.
- Progressives worried about the distractions of a war in Europe that could draw the U.S. into conflict and sidetrack domestic reform.
- Social engineering held the promise of meeting human needs, improving mechanisms for class reconciliation, and perfecting democratic institutions.
- *What happened to the progressive movement?*
- World War I came; Reformers lost their sense of direction and war intensified their divisions.
  - Progressives took on an anti-radical ton, and racial undercurrents of the progressive thought began to surface.
  - Conservative opponents were empowered by the frenzy of patriotic nationalism amid war.

*Deep Contradictions and Divisions in the Progressive Movement*
- Progressives were divided over how to create social harmony.
- The persistence of class conflict in America threatened this promise of social harmony through democratic renewal.
- War exacerbated division in the Progressive movement. 
  - War energized reformers that embraced preparedness and war as an opportunity to forge national unity.
  - War despaired antiwar Progressives that feared the war would undermine progressive ends through a loss of life, conservative nationalism, and coercive state power.
- In the second arena of reform, war produced further differences.
- Despite calls for national unity, economic conditions of war unleashed dramatic waves of strikes.
  - Labor activists in basic industry seized war opportunities to challenge employed for higher wages, shorter hours, and a stronger voice in the industry.
- Reformers hoped to use war's emergency to realign relationships between labor and capital.
- Labor Progressives hoped to find a model for expanded public ownership in the postwar period.

#### Progressive Positions Amid War
- Many Progressives found new rhetorical uses for the term "the people" as a way of embodying national identity and democratic culture.
- The war appeared initially to be a gift to progressivism and gave reformers nationalist rhetoric to use.
- **Embracing war was not an easy proposition** for many progressive reformers.
  - When war broke out, many reformers feared the democratic hope was to be bulldozed.
  - Yet, there was still hope that efficient management to achieve public control could be done through the agency of large corporations.

*John Dewey and State Power*
- John Dewey exerted perhaps the greatest influence on progressive thought.
- Dewey envisioned a process of social reconstruction driven forward by voluntary association.
  - Education played a key role in this vision.
  - Only through education could class divisions and social hierarchies be resolved.
- Dewey recognized the necessity and value in state or national direction.
  - Advocated that schools teach community interest over private interest.
  - American schools were to foster equal opportunity and democratic values.
  - Dewey embraced postwar demonstrations of practical possibilities of government regulation of private business.
- Dewey advocated for an alternative federation of self-governing industries, in which the state would function as an *adjuster* instead of outright managing them.
  - Reflects a hesitancy from a massive and permanent extension of state power.

*Anti-War Progressivism*
- Lines of opposition to the war wavered and broke.
- Nevertheless, antiwar Progressives maintained faith in reform.
- Frustrated by class warfare and manipulation of the sense of national community, antiwar Progressives projected their democratic faith in unique ways.
  - Advocating peace and reconciliation, these Progressives looked towards the postwar era.
- Jane Addams worked with the Food Administration to ensure the survival of a war-ravaged population.
  - Addams and other antiwar settlement reformers carried forward practical and domestic reform centered around the needs of women and children.
- Some "war intellectuals" were found to be naive and delusional at best, and cynical at worst.
- The war disabled a promising movement for reform.

#### Campaigning for Industrial Democracy
- Many reformers say a different kind of opportunity in the war.
- Industrial democracy implied a "socializing" of industry; forging new ties among laboring people based on shared class interest.
- In war, these views set apart a coalition of labor reformers and socialists from dominant currents of progressive reform that favored class reconciliation and social harmony.
- Labor Progressives maintained close ties to militant wings of the labor movement.
- Strikes rose in 1916 to a peak in 1919; this *energized* the labor Progressives' vision.
  - The war's end saw a sharp decline in the authority granted to federal labor boards.
- While the federal government maintained some wartime reform initiatives, Progressive reformers lost their connection to the distinctive domestic reform agenda.
- A wave of postwar strikes, race riots, and antiradical persecution reinforced sentiments of skepticism towards democracy and the possibility of assimilating difference.
- Labor Progressives were splintered in the postwar period.
  - One wing advocated for efficiency and worker-management cooperation. 
    - Staked positions in a few industries, where they promoted new class harmonization strategies.
  - Another more radical wing of industrial democrats pursued reforms including the nationalization of railroads and coal.

#### The Legacies of Progressive Reform
- Remnants of the reform community that had been the core of the Progressive movement felt a rightward shift in American politics during the 1920s.
- Reformers drifted in greater isolation from centers of public power than prewar.
- Still unwilling to frame problems in terms of class, these reformers shared little common ground with industrial democrats.
- A coalition of reformers and trade unionists sought to invest in "harmony of interests" by establishing a framework for industrial relations.
- John Dewey in 1935 offered an alternative to class conflict.
  - A liberalism that saw a socialized economy as the means of free individual development.
- Dewey believed an organized "intelligence" could settle conflicting interests.
- Labor's achievement of the right to bargain collectively seemed to promise a resolution to the class problem.
- New Deal liberalism was not monolithic; while rejecting class perspective, New Deal liberals adopted Progressive core values.
  - The state was employed to engineer a society inclusive of "the people" and less vulnerable to societal upheavals.
- Later liberal reformers focused their attention on racial and ethnic discrimination.
  - Nazism gave urgency to the meaning of racial and ethnic differences in a democratic society
- Reconfiguring of liberalism further displaced the class problem.
- Social change in its racial dimension would dominate postwar liberal reform.
  - Social legislation of the 1960s addressed **civil and social, not economic** rights primarily.
- Problems of racial assimilation and politics of identity dominated liberal discourse and a quest for a democratic community.
- Liberals late in the 20th century were often accused of promoting the class perspective they persistently fought.
