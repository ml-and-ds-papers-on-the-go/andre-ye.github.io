### Preamble of the National Relations Act, 1935
- Employers denying employees the ability ot organize and the refusal of employers to accept collective bargaining leads inevitably to strikes nad unrest.
- These strikes obstruct commerce by
  1. impairing the safety and efficiency of commerce;
  2. occurring in the same space as commerce;
  3. affecting the control of raw materials
  4. causing a reduction in employment and wages to disrupt the market.
- When employees cannot bargan but employers organize with others, the flow of commerce is effected, and provokes business depressions.
- Protection by law of employees to organize and bargain can safeguard commerce from disruption.
  - Removes obvious sources of industrial unrest.
  - Restoring equality of bargaining power between employers and employees.
- The United States policy will hence be to encourage collective bargaining and protection of worker's freedoms of association, organization, and designation of representatives.
