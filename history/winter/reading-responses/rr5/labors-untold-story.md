### The Committee for Industrial Organization
- A revolutionary, apocalyptic time; generations had battled in vain to accomplish what would be accomplished soon.
- A time of youth and growth; the red scare was laft at and the new was welcomed.
- Triumph and courage were infectious; many read of unprecedented sit-downs reducing General Motors.
  - It seemed that *labor was winning*.
- **Thousands of singing picket lines somehow knew of the labor martyrs and the endless discrimination against black people.**
  > "They had a sense of history in that all felt strongly that the time of long defeat was coming to an end."
- An explosive mood.
  - The NRA (FDR's National Recovery Administration) was seen to be ineffective.
  - Wages in steel were one-third of the minimum level needed to maintain a family.
- 1935: the NRA was declared unconstitutional and the Wagner Labor Act was passed.
- The Wagner Act (as had the NRA) gave labor collective bargaining rights.
  - Labor knew tht this right would only be effective as labor made it.
- 35m organizable workers clamored for protection of a union.
- The AFL did not wait to take advantage of a large oppurtunity to organize the unorganized.
  - John L. Lewis punched William Hutchenson (symbol of AFL's refusal to organize millions industrially).
  - Symbolic of a **split between eight AFL unions**.
  - A carefully planned assault.
- The Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) was born with the purpose of working *within* the AFL, rather than establishing an independent organization.
- A drive to organize millions of unskilled workers was underway.
- Boiling over had already begun before the CIO had even opened their office.
  - Hotel walk-outs, artists battling police; a national torrent of strikes.
- **Sit-ins** were an effective striking tool: staying in the struck area.
  - Protection from weather and police assaults.
  - Owner's fear that machines would be injured if workers were attacked.
- All over the countries, workers were striking.
  - Even high school students, prisoners, electric storage battery workers, dressmakers, hosiery workers, bridge operators.
  - Within six months the CIO had 2m members, 1m having just joined.
- August 4th, 1936; AFL Exec. Council *suspended* CIO unions and later expelled them.
  - Warned that the CIO was a communistic plot, but the CIO's numbers kept on growing.
  - Formal charge made agaist the CIO: dual unionism and refusal to abide by majority rule.
- United Electrical (UE), Radio and Machine Workers of America, organized in March, 1936.
  - Even with unfavorable publicity, UE grew.
  - Governor Hoffman of New Jersey launched an attack on UE; thousands of electrical workers heard of UE for the first time and joined.
  - 1936 UE strike; bloody and violent.
    - Sentence for strikers: the union and strike were communist plots.
  - Wages were raised minimally.
- September 1936, UE and shipyard workers joined the CIO; made a crucial difference in the organization, proving that it could attract new and growing mass unions.

### Sit-down at Flint
- Strategists of the CIO intended to organize the union-breaking steel industry first.
  - Spontaneous surge of organization and the success of the sit-down tactic made them change.
- The automobile industry was particularly brutal towards workers.
- Workers who attempted union organization were fired.
  - A belief that arbitrary discharge would keep men docile.
- This terror and repression succeeding in filling auto workers with bitterness.
- 1930: Auto Workers Union struck the GM (General Motors) Fisher Body Plant Number One at Flint.
  - 1933: Skilled Tool and Die Makers walked out.
  - The strikes was defeated and the strikers were blacklisted.
- Auto workers flooded tot he new AFL federal union; however, AFL officials objected to recognizing the unions.
- The Auto Workers Union withdrew from the AFL in 1936 and joined the CIO.
- Massive corporations like GM essentially owned plants, courts, police, and cities.
- By Jan. 4, sit-downers were in possession of GM plants at 6 locations, especially Flint, Michigan.
  - Flint was gripped by imminent civil war.
  - This united force, though, sent Roosevelt into action, sent John L. Lewis to negotiate, and imperiled the political career of Frank Murphy - governor of Michiagan.
- The firmness of these workers built the CIO; invisible impulses connected the sit-downers in Flint with every member of the working class in the United States.
- Many legislators believed the sit-downers should be forceably removed, and that the attempt was a communist ploy.
  - John L. Lewis instead argued that this incident had come from GM refusing to obey the Wagner Labor Act.
  > "The CIO stands squarely behind these sit-downs."
- Governor Murphy brought GM officials and Lewis together.
  - Murphy feared bloodshed, Knudsen feared damage to the plant.
  - Attempt to turn off the heat in Flint plants; was retaliated against.
  - Attempt to starve the Flint sit-downers; women bringing food to their husbands were shot at.
- On the 35th day, Flint authorities began arming hundreds of vigilantes. Tensions were rising and Governor Murphy had to make a decision.
  - He continued to push for negotiation, but it could not be done.
  - Murphy ordered troops of the National Gaurd to clear the plants; hesitated after meeting Lewis.
- Eventually GM surrendered; they announced they would recognize the union and negotioate nationally.
- Within a year wages in the auto industry had increased by $300,000, and the UAW has grown from 30k members to 50k.
