### The Committee for Industrial Organization
- A revolutionary, apocalyptic time; generations had battled in vain to accomplish what would be accomplished soon.
- A time of youth and growth; the red scare was laft at and the new was welcomed.
- Triumph and courage were infectious; many read of unprecedented sit-downs reducing General Motors.
  - It seemed that *labor was winning*.
- **Thousands of singing picket lines somehow knew of the labor martyrs and the endless discrimination against black people.**
  > "They had a sense of history in that all felt strongly that the time of long defeat was coming to an end."
- An explosive mood.
  - The NRA (FDR's National Recovery Administration) was seen to be ineffective.
  - Wages in steel were one-third of the minimum level needed to maintain a family.
- 1935: the NRA was declared unconstitutional and the Wagner Labor Act was passed.
- The Wagner Act (as had the NRA) gave labor collective bargaining rights.
  - Labor knew tht this right would only be effective as labor made it.
- 35m organizable workers clamored for protection of a union.
- The AFL did not wait to take advantage of a large oppurtunity to organize the unorganized.
  - John L. Lewis punched William Hutchenson (symbol of AFL's refusal to organize millions industrially).
  - Symbolic of a **split between eight AFL unions**.
  - A carefully planned assault.
- The Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) was born with the purpose of working *within* the AFL, rather than establishing an independent organization.
- A drive to organize millions of unskilled workers was underway.
- Boiling over had already begun before the CIO had even opened their office.
  - Hotel walk-outs, artists battling police; a national torrent of strikes.
- **Sit-ins** were an effective striking tool: staying in the struck area.
  - Protection from weather and police assaults.
  - Owner's fear that machines would be injured if workers were attacked.
- All over the countries, workers were striking.
  - Even high school students, prisoners, electric storage battery workers, dressmakers, hosiery workers, bridge operators.
  - Within six months the CIO had 2m members, 1m having just joined.
- August 4th, 1936; AFL Exec. Council *suspended* CIO unions and later expelled them.
  - Warned that the CIO was a communistic plot, but the CIO's numbers kept on growing.
  - Formal charge made agaist the CIO: dual unionism and refusal to abide by majority rule.
- United Electrical (UE), Radio and Machine Workers of America, organized in March, 1936.
  - Even with unfavorable publicity, UE grew.
  - Governor Hoffman of New Jersey launched an attack on UE; thousands of electrical workers heard of UE for the first time and joined.
  - 1936 UE strike; bloody and violent.
    - Sentence for strikers: the union and strike were communist plots.
  - Wages were raised minimally.
- September 1936, UE and shipyard workers joined the CIO; made a crucial difference in the organization, proving that it could attract new and growing mass unions.
