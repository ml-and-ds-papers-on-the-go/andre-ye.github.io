## Introduction
> I am an anarchist. I suppose you came here, the most of you, to see what Ia real, live anarchist looked like. I suppose some of you expected to see me with a bomb in one hand and a flaming torch in the other, but are disappointed in seeing neither.
- Anarchists are peaceful and law abiding people, Parsons argues; people have misconstrued what it is to be an anarchist.
  - Parsons defines anarchy as "the state of being without political rule", although it has been misrepresented as "chaos".

## The Rationale for Anarchy
- Is America truly a great land of liberty?
- New York; count the homeless, the starving, and the slaves.
- Those that dare call America a land of liberty pay no attention to the poor, Parsons argues.
- Capitalists control the earth - which should be free for all - to boost their own profits.
- The oppression and misery extends beyond just New York.
- **Political systems serve only to continually push power into the hands of a few.**

## Unjustified Opposition to Anarchists and the Haymarket Incident
- Many believe anarchists have no right to exist at all.
- Arrests and succeeding arrests were effected by detectives - Pinkerton detectives set up by the capitalists, Parsons argues.
- The Constitution says there are inalienable rights like free press, free speech, and free assemblage.
  - Citizens can repel the unlawful invasion of these rights.
- The meeting at Haymarket square was peaceable; if "murderous" police arrived to the scene to disperse, Parsons "would have flung the bomb myself," for such an action would be *in defense* of the Constitution.
- If anarchists truly planned to destroy cities and to massacre the police, whyw ere such few weapons employed?
  - It was not their intention to do so.
  - Murder from the policeman to the civilian is as much murder as the civilian to the policeman.
  - Attributes the detonation of the bomb as a result of unjustified police action.

## Dynamite and Historical Significance
- Feudal system at the height of its power during the discovery of dynamite.
  - This discovery 'made the middle classes'.
- The bomb in Chicago sounds the fall of the 19th century wage system.
  - Intelligent people do not submit to despotism.
  - Argues her actions are for the people.
  
## Improper Court Precedings
- After the bombs exploded, arrests were made; yet the judicial system was biased.
  - A Knight of Labor or some other labor sympathizer would have not been considered competent to serve on a jury.
- The ruling was without precedent and contrary to law, reason, or common sense.
- Witnesses for prosecution were selectively chosen, bribed,  nad intimidated; their evidence was nevertheless held as competent.
- Red and black flags brought into court;
  - The black flag symbolizes suffering;
  - The red flag symbolizes the red blood that courses through the veins of the whole human race.
    - The idle shall be called to work; the end of prostitution for women, slavery for men, and hunger for children.

## Conclusion
- Liberty has been repurposed as anarchy.
  - Capitalism has reappropriate liberty such that you can have it if you can pay for it.
> Bread is freedom and freedom is bread.
