## Introduction
- Civil War to the end of the 19th century: **turmoil for the American working class.**
  - Workers fought violent industrial conflicts in American history.
- A variety of political movements transpired.

## The Shock of Change
- Extensive industrialization produced a large shock to the social order.
- 1865-1897: orthodox values and community structures shattered by economic & social change.
  - Giant business corporations and urban concentrations of people shifted meanings of concepts like liberty and oppurtunity.
- A *Gesellshcaft* society supersceded *Gemeinshaft* one; formal rules of social behavior superceeded traditional law, customary norms.
  - Industrial communities succumbed to society; the personal relationship became bureaucratic.
- Technology created a national & international economy.
- Regardless, many lived in "island communities"; customary arrangements were the norm.
  - Working people defined lives in terms of family, neighborhood, and church.
  - Productive economic forces surpassed the ability of human institutions to control them.
- **When elites dominated society, this frustrated the masses** of a less technological and bureaucratic nature.
  - A failure of political parties and social structures to offer a sense of security in this chaotic environment.

### Changing Relationships Between Workers and Employers
- Workers did not enter postbellum industrial expansion as powerless; in 1870s and 1880s workers had some level of power on their employers.
  - Iron, steel, and farm machinery: workers united in craft unions were indispensable.
- Craftsmen that scored successes in wages yielded rewards for semiskilled and unskilled workers as well.
- Workers could also control local offices like mayor, sheriff, or county judge.
- In these island communities, industrialists were seen as alien to an established community.
- Industrialists did not feel all-powerful; technological and economic forces vexed workers and employers.
  - New machines and production processes altered competitiveness of less efficient businesses.
  - Industralists sought greater economic security alongside their workers.
- Two paths to economic security:
  1. Corporate merging and concentration. This reduces competition in key industries; peaked between 1897 and 1904. Conflicted with traditional American values of individualism, free competition, and equal oppurtunity.
  2. Employers exerted unilateral authority over employee wages, hours, and working conditions. This disciplinary effort ran against workers and the island communities.

## Industrial Conflict
- Workers attempted to preserve or expand their power; employers sought additional authority over their employees.
- Bitter battles of labor and capital.
  - Molly Maguire and coal district notoriety;
  - railroad strikes and riots of 1877;
  - Haymarket bombing of 1886;
  - Homestead nad Coeur d'Alene conflicts of 1892, where troops subdued militant strikers;
  - Pullman railroad boycott of 1894, where the federal government was set in direct opposition to striking workers.
- Other battles occurred on a more local level
  - Nonviolent strikes also marred hte industrial history of the period.
- Striking had become the wage worker's primary defense against employers by the end of the 19th century.
  - Strikes became more planned and less spontaneous, associated with unions.

### Conflicts Between Anthracite Miners and Mine Owners
- Occurred in northeastern Pennsylvania.
- Older narrative romanticized the situation: noble operators protected the local community against criminimal anarchists ('Mollies'), or courageous miners defined rederess of grievances.
- Anthracite district of Penn. experienced rapid economic & population growth immediately postbellum. 
  - Attracted thousands of new miners tot he district.
  - Economic competition, rising rates of industrial accidents, and a breakdown of law occurred.
- Economic insecurity was compoundded by constant surveillance and restriction.
  - In response, Workingmen's Benevolent Association (WBA) formed.
  - Won success in anthracite fields from 1869 to 1873 under John Siney.
  - Placed limits on authority of authority.
- Economic depression of 1873; unemployed miners were a further burden on the community.
- Franklin B. Gowen - pres. of Reading Railroad.
  - Sought to reduce competition among smaller operators, and disciplined miners by disassembling their unions.
  - With a monopoly on the market, Gowen forced other operators to follow his policies on prices, wages, and union negotiation.
  - Quitely purchased all coal properties available, removing "destructive" competition.
  - Yet the WBA remained as a force between Gowen and entire domination of the anthracite district.
- Gowen's purposes were aided by economic depression and community fears; crime seemed to be rampant.
  - Due to ethnic tensions, Irish immigrants were exploited by British superiors.
  - The Irish retaliated; violence in the district was hence partly ethnic. However, the conflict is primarily class, not ethnic.
- Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) - fraternal society of Irish immigrants.
- Gowen was committed to breaking the WBA and realized defense of law & order made a better public platform than antiunionism.
  - Worked with the Catholic Bishop of Philadelphia and anthracite district law officials; evidence was raised agains tthe WBA.
- Long Strike: a January-April 1875 conflict that brought suffering to miners and their families; increased local violence.
- Trials against Mollies; the jury returned a guilty verdict and 20 Mollies were hanged.
  - Mollies were linked with unionism and lawlessness.
  - By linking the WBA with the Mollies, killed unionism in the district.
  
### Other Conflicts and Industrialist Tactics for Strike Repression
- Most industrialists lacked Irish-immigrant scapegoats, but neverhteless harnessed violence and defense of the law to turn in their own advantage.
  - 1873-1876; employers that encoutered a powerful workforce would engage in inevitable violence.
  - Strikebreakers were often recruited; tensions were often exacerbated by ethnic and racial characteristics of many strikebreakers. Compounded economic and social fault lines; raised violence to a higher level.
  - In the process, employers acted as ardent defenders of property rights and law & orders.
    - Often relied upon governors or presidents to provide marshals and troops.
- Workers saw local power usurped by external sources of authority functioning for the industrialists.

### 1877 Railroad Strikes
- Financially strained railroads in 1877 cut workers' wages sharply and increased workloads.
  - Stimulated mass anger and a unionization attempt.
- July; Baltimore & Ohio Railroad announced third 10% cut in wages; a spontaneous walkout erupted.
  - Strikes spread to become the most massive and destructive conflict in the late 19th century.
- 1877 strikes were too turblent for local and even state powers to control; a middle-class citizen decried the collapse of law & order.
  - Milita were often too undisciplined and onlye scalated the violence.
- Railroad leaders turned to Washington; federal authorities were informed of anarchy.
  - Rutherford B. Hayes issued a proclamation declaring a state of emergency and insurrection, dispatched federal troops.
  - Law and order was maintained at the expense of a group of strikers.
- Local law enforcement officials eleected by working-class votes assisted strikers; employers would often resort to external sources of power.
- Between 1877 and 1886, the balance of power between workers and their employers had tipped in favor of the industrialists.
- Business owners seemed to be more adept than laborers at organizing associations; businesses grew in size and capital resources.
  - Less pressure from competitors, firms were stronger in disciplining their workers.
  - Strikes at one plant could be defeated by shifting production to another plant.
- Technological iinnovation undercut the strength and security of workers; craftsmen found their skills superfluous.
- Economic power of employers and alliance with government bred frustration among militant workers.

### Haymarket Square Incident
- 1880s militant workers and radical agitators often resorted to rhetoric of violence, especially in Chicago.
  - 1886 Chicago: center of radical and anarchist activities.
- In May 1886, police and strikers clashed; death of two workers.
- August Spies - anarchist and agitator - called for protest meeting at Haymarket Square on May 4th.
  - A small crowd turned out and the oratory was uninspiring.
  - Before the meeting adjourned, special police charged the crowd and a bomb was tossed in.
- The bomb killed police and civilians alike; Chicago authorities and middle-upper classes were convinced of insurrectionary violence.
- Police officials, city authorities, newspapers, etc. contributed to the conspiracy. Althoguh the actual bomb thrower was never found, the eight were convicted and seven were hanged.
- Propagandist campaigns that linked trade unionism with anarchy spread.
- Furthermore, strikers and milita clashed in Bay View, Wisconsin.
  - A Polish iron worker used crowd action to close iron foundries; ten were shot fatally to end the strike.

### Andrew Carnegie and Industrialist Desire to Destroy Trade Unions
- 1870s-1880s: Amalgamated Association fo Iron and Steel Workers was the most powerful craft union of the nation.
  - Members could only watch as steel production grew more important and Andrew Carnegie produced interruptions with union agreement.
- Carnegie wanted to end the union's influence.
- Conflict: battle of Homestead on July 6th, 1892; workers won but were later quashed on July 10 when the governor of Pennsylvania responded to requests to protect private property.
  - Under protection of the militia, strikebreakers went to work and forced workers to work.
  - November 1892, the union surrended completely.

#### Lessons from Two Decades of Industrial Conflict
- Labor lacked to power to challenge concentrated capital.
- When workers had short-term ability to stalemate employers, the state intervened.
- If employers sought to drive out unions, workers had no choice but to fight back.

### The Pullman Boycott
- The conflict revealed respective strength and political power of workers and employers; industrialists' power grew far past that of employees.
  - Workers were divided by demographic, but employers were united through mergers and trade associations.
  - Railroads suffered from excessive competition; railroad managers made informal and formal alliances to cure this.
- American Railway Union (ARU) launched a strike and won a notable victory; immediately began entangled in a conflict.
  - Members boycotted all railroads using Pullman cars; most railroad traffic was brought to a halt.
- Grover Cleveland and the Attorney General threw resources of the federal government against the strikers.

### Conclusions and Discussion
- This discussion of industrial conflict questions assumptions of American social order.
- Workers are distinguished from employers not by values, behaviors, or goals, but simply by capital owned.
- Most discussions of American history are very abstracted; people did indeed enjoy simple joys.
- Still, does democratic-republicanism carry the same implications for both social classes?
- Hard work was praised as the creator of human progress and happiness; capital was defined as the product of past labor.
- Most Americans shared a commitment to republican principles, yet power and interest were issues of deadly conflict.

## Labor Confronts the Law
- The law was a battleground in which shared values and principles favored employers.
- Late 19th century law generally allowed trade unions to exist legally.
  - Unions and practices were no longer criminal conspiracies, yet they remained parchment rights.
- Neither businesspeople nor workers could restrain trade, limit the freedom of others, or hurt general interest.
  - State and federal judges compelled employers to recognize unions.
  - Yet, "taking law into their own hands" is not tolerated.
- Regulations on labor, wages, and working condition were deemed unconstitutional because of legal principles of individual liberty and free contract.
- However, judges and the law did not always operate with consistency; regulation of underground miners was sometimes found to be justified (i.e. within power to regulate dangerou subsinses).
- **Confrantation of organized labor with the law was unpleasant;** judges taught trade unionists they could not strike with the support of the state, or ask the state to regulate employers in the interest of labor.
- Workers continued to worship common principles, and industrialists & allies **rewrote the rules of the game**; transforming the established structure of the community and traditional values.
- Industrialists suceeded because they were the first to learn the problems of industrial society that escaped individual solutions.
