## Navigate

## Introduction
- Civil War to the end of the 19th century: **turmoil for the American working class.**
  - Workers fought violent industrial conflicts in American history.
- A variety of political movements transpired.

## The Shock of Change
- Extensive industrialization produced a large shock to the social order.
- 1865-1897: orthodox values and community structures shattered by economic & social change.
  - Giant business corporations and urban concentrations of people shifted meanings of concepts like liberty and oppurtunity.
- A *Gesellshcaft* society supersceded *Gemeinshaft* one; formal rules of social behavior superceeded traditional law, customary norms.
  - Industrial communities succumbed to society; the personal relationship became bureaucratic.
- Technology created a national & international economy.
- Regardless, many lived in "island communities"; customary arrangements were the norm.
  - Working people defined lives in terms of family, neighborhood, and church.
  - Productive economic forces surpassed the ability of human institutions to control them.
- **When elites dominated society, this frustrated the masses** of a less technological and bureaucratic nature.
  - A failure of political parties and social structures to offer a sense of security in this chaotic environment.

### Changing Relationships Between Workers and Employers
- Workers did not enter postbellum industrial expansion as powerless; in 1870s and 1880s workers had some level of power on their employers.
  - Iron, steel, and farm machinery: workers united in craft unions were indispensable.
- Craftsmen that scored successes in wages yielded rewards for semiskilled and unskilled workers as well.
- Workers could also control local offices like mayor, sheriff, or county judge.
- In these island communities, industrialists were seen as alien to an established community.
- Industrialists did not feel all-powerful; technological and economic forces vexed workers and employers.
  - New machines and production processes altered competitiveness of less efficient businesses.
  - Industralists sought greater economic security alongside their workers.
- Two paths to economic security:
  1. Corporate merging and concentration. This reduces competition in key industries; peaked between 1897 and 1904. Conflicted with traditional American values of individualism, free competition, and equal oppurtunity.
  2. Employers exerted unilateral authority over employee wages, hours, and working conditions. This disciplinary effort ran against workers and the island communities.
