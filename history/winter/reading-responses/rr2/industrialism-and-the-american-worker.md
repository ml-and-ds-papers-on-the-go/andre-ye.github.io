## Navigate

## Introduction
- Civil War to the end of the 19th century: **turmoil for the American working class.**
  - Workers fought violent industrial conflicts in American history.
- A variety of political movements transpired.

## The Shock of Change
- Extensive industrialization produced a large shock to the social order.
- 1865-1897: orthodox values and community structures shattered by economic & social change.
  - Giant business corporations and urban concentrations of people shifted meanings of concepts like liberty and oppurtunity.
- A *Gesellshcaft* society supersceded *Gemeinshaft* one; formal rules of social behavior superceeded traditional law, customary norms.
  - Industrial communities succumbed to society; the personal relationship became bureaucratic.
- Technology created a national & international economy.
- Regardless, many lived in "island communities"; customary arrangements were the norm.
  - Working people defined lives in terms of family, neighborhood, and church.
  - Productive economic forces surpassed the ability of human institutions to control them.
- **When elites dominated society, this frustrated the masses** of a less technological and bureaucratic nature.
  - A failure of political parties and social structures to offer a sense of security in this chaotic environment.

### Changing Relationships Between Workers and Employers
- Workers did not enter postbellum industrial expansion as powerless; in 1870s and 1880s workers had some level of power on their employers.
  - Iron, steel, and farm machinery: workers united in craft unions were indispensable.
- Craftsmen that scored successes in wages yielded rewards for semiskilled and unskilled workers as well.
- Workers could also control local offices like mayor, sheriff, or county judge.
- In these island communities, industrialists were seen as alien to an established community.
- Industrialists did not feel all-powerful; technological and economic forces vexed workers and employers.
  - New machines and production processes altered competitiveness of less efficient businesses.
  - Industralists sought greater economic security alongside their workers.
- Two paths to economic security:
  1. Corporate merging and concentration. This reduces competition in key industries; peaked between 1897 and 1904. Conflicted with traditional American values of individualism, free competition, and equal oppurtunity.
  2. Employers exerted unilateral authority over employee wages, hours, and working conditions. This disciplinary effort ran against workers and the island communities.

## Industrial Conflict
- Workers attempted to preserve or expand their power; employers sought additional authority over their employees.
- Bitter battles of labor and capital.
  - Molly Maguire and coal district notoriety;
  - railroad strikes and riots of 1877;
  - Haymarket bombing of 1886;
  - Homestead nad Coeur d'Alene conflicts of 1892, where troops subdued militant strikers;
  - Pullman railroad boycott of 1894, where the federal government was set in direct opposition to striking workers.
- Other battles occurred on a more local level
  - Nonviolent strikes also marred hte industrial history of the period.
- Striking had become the wage worker's primary defense against employers by the end of the 19th century.
  - Strikes became more planned and less spontaneous, associated with unions.

### Conflicts Between Anthracite Miners and Mine Owners
- Occurred in northeastern Pennsylvania.
- Older narrative romanticized the situation: noble operators protected the local community against criminimal anarchists ('Mollies'), or courageous miners defined rederess of grievances.
- Anthracite district of Penn. experienced rapid economic & population growth immediately postbellum. 
  - Attracted thousands of new miners tot he district.
  - Economic competition, rising rates of industrial accidents, and a breakdown of law occurred.
- Economic insecurity was compoundded by constant surveillance and restriction.
  - In response, Workingmen's Benevolent Association (WBA) formed.
  - Won success in anthracite fields from 1869 to 1873 under John Siney.
  - Placed limits on authority of authority.
- Economic depression of 1873; unemployed miners were a further burden on the community.
- Franklin B. Gowen - pres. of Reading Railroad.
  - Sought to reduce competition among smaller operators, and disciplined miners by disassembling their unions.
  - With a monopoly on the market, Gowen forced other operators to follow his policies on prices, wages, and union negotiation.
  - Quitely purchased all coal properties available, removing "destructive" competition.
  - Yet the WBA remained as a force between Gowen and entire domination of the anthracite district.
- Gowen's purposes were aided by economic depression and community fears; crime seemed to be rampant.
  - Due to ethnic tensions, Irish immigrants were exploited by British superiors.
  - The Irish retaliated; violence in the district was hence partly ethnic. However, the conflict is primarily class, not ethnic.
