# Notes on *On Agency* by Walter Johnson
Andre Ye, 1/5/21

- A common way to frame "agency" is to argue that enslaved people "preserved their humanity".
  - By framing this as a question - black humanity or not - and arguing as if it is groundbreaking that the answer is yes, Johnson argues, white supremacist assumptions are furthered.
- "Preserving humanity" simply means the author believes they acted like human beings would.
  - Discussing humanity and "humanness" in relation to agency is too abstract.
- People that are human are agents.
  - "Agency" has a long history, but is used primarily as *self-directed* action (i.e. "personal", "independent will").
  - Hence, the term carries with it liberal universality of selfhood - independence and choice.
    - In the time of slavery, what was natural went against this.
- By applying self-determination and choice, historians have assumed liberal "agency" such that enslaved "humanity" itself is a resistance to slavery.

<br>

- "Agency" is not necessarily resistant to slavery. Instead, ask: what is the condition of enslaved humanity?
- Basic features of the lives of enslaved people are not reducible to features of slavery.

<br>

- "Agency" is also thought of as importance of one's purpose. It is not true that it must be a resistance; the two should not be conflated.
- Framed as "everyday" to "revolutionary" resistance.
- Many argue that the "everyday" resistance somehow *implicitly* threatens slavery. It is looking for agency to be some sort of resistance.
  - Being Nat Turner and breaking a tool are both instances of agency, yet have different causes and consequences.
- Historians have framed "agency" to reduce acts of resistance into larger and abstract human capacities.
  - This obscures important questions about how enslaved people thought about their actions and the process through which they changed.

<br>

- Collective resistance is a process of everyday organization and depends on connections and trust. Collective resistance also depends on remapping of everyday life in historical terms.
  - The *system* of slavery is the cause of suffering.
- Cultural autonomy itself has been seen as even a form of resistance.
  - It helped resistance against the *system* of slavery, but was not directly in contradiction to it.
- Enslaved people of history must be treated as "agents", for if they are not, then it is replaced by "culture".

<br>

- "giving the slaves back their agency" is an advertisement of good will.
- They are gestures that imagine something; they are overtly political and an attempt to tie the past to the present in a way that is not needed anymore.
- It is more so to release rather than to declare moral and ethical obligations.
- Scholarship on the past should not be framed as a redress.
