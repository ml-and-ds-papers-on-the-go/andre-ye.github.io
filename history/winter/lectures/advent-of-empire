### Introduction
- Miss Columbia's School House, 1894.
  - How is the "education" going?
  - Depicts internal borders and the process of immigration: it is going quite poorly.
  - Can be read as an anti-imperialist or anti-expansionist message, as the U.S. considers bringing in new territories: *is it possible?*
- **Central Questions:** Why Empire? What drove U.S. imperial expansion in the 19th and 20th centuries? What is the relationship of economic factors, ideology, race, state power, and violence in U.S. expansion?
  - U.S. origins are founded in the Concept of Empire
    - Thomas Jefferson and the Empire of Liberty
    - Conquest of Native Lands up to 1890
  - Economic Expansions and the Quest for New Markets
    - The Spanish American War
  - America's Race Thinking and the Problem of Exclusions
    - International Component - Conquest of New Lands and Open Door Policy
    - Domestic Component - who is fit for civilization?
  - Resistance to War and Imperialism
    - "War is the Health of the State"

### The Spanish American War
- Seen as the "moment" of the development.
  - It's important to be grounded in what this is.
- By the 1890s, the Spanish Empire (founded with conquest) is collapsing, in a free fall.
  - A series of nationalist revolutions all throughout the Spanish empire.
  - Created several independent countries - Mexico, Venezuela, Bolivia, etc.
- A process of decolonization has been occuring, and the Spanish continue to hold some more important colonies - the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Cuba, etc.
  - No longer able to hold it.
  - Anti-colonial natioanal liberation movements emerge in all of their colonies, modelled on the American revolution from the 1790s.
- United States is depicted as protecting Cuba from the nasty Spanish conquerers (cartoon).
- Giving the U.S. the oppurtunity to think of itself as an expansionist nation.

### Empire of Liberty?
- The United States invades Cuba and the Philippines - seen as a major transformative point?
  - Some historicans have begun questioning that point.
- Jefferson writes to the revolutionary army; writes that it's important colonials access the fort because we're trying to establish an *empire of liberty*.
  - Not a monarchist and oppressive government like the British, but an expansion based on democracy and liberty.
  - A beacon of freedom rather than one of oppression and tyranny.
- Opening up the American continent for settlement; justified with the conception of Emprie of Liberty.
  - Concieved as a contest between European empires.
  - A process of territorial expansion into foreign-held space and violence with a self-conception of *empire*.
- *What has changed, what is significant about what is happening in the 1890s?*

#### Battle of Wounded Knees
- "The Closing of the American Frontier"
- The notion of territorial expansion across the continent is being closed as the government militarily conquers this space.
  - "Pacifies" indigenious resistance to American expansion.
- 1890 Battle; the U.S. switches its policies from Indian Removal (pushing indigenious people into territories) to Reservation (creating reserves for indigenious people to live on).
- Pursuing this policy at a time when plains Indians develop a "ghost dance" process.
  - A lament, memorial to all of the indigenious peoples that have been killed and died through these hundred-years of conquest.
  - Also a messianic quality; by enacting the ghost dance, plains people would come together for rituals and call forth a Messiah.
  - All of those lost peoples would come forth and be present, to create a moment that would stop the advance of white settlers; to create a new-formed indigenious society.
- The U.S. didn't like this process, because it brought people from all regions together, disrupting the reservation process; furthermore, conflicting political overtones.
  - U.S. attempted to stop the process of the dance.
  - Come to arrest the Lakota Sioux chief, Sitting Bull.
  - Arrive at an encampment to sieze and arrest Sitting Bull.
  - In a conflict, there is shooting and Sitting Bull is killed in that arrest attempt.
- The hundreds of Sioux that are in the encampment flee, where the American army pursues them; catches up to them at Wounded Knee Creek
  - In the middle of Winter, proceed to halt the fleeing people.
  - The American army opens up on the fleeing people, killing everyone.
  - Very few survivors escaped.
- "The end of the ghost dance".
