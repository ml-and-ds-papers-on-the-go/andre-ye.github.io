### Introduction
- Introductory art: George Bellows, *New York*, 1911.
  - An emphasis on light; buildings are illuminated across the plaza.
  - What is it like to be in a city in which massive skyscrapers cause large shafts of light to jut out between buildings.
  - Expresses the optimism and hope of progressive development and urbanism; yet the chaotic mess and swirl of the modern urban world without structure and regulation.
  - Comes from the *Ashcan* school tradition fo art.
- The Guilded Age was filled with class conflict and violence; perhaps these tensions should be mitigated.
- **Contrast notions of "progress" at the turn of the century**
  - Central Questions: What factors make rpogressive social change possible? What is "progressie" social change? How important is social history, intellectual history, race, and class to understand the proigressive era?
  - Jim Crow in American society
    - Jim Crow was slowly built over decades of rolling back black political empowerment, and constructing and reinforcing white supremacy in law.
    - Entrenched racial segregation and racial conceptions of progressivism.
  - The Social Question, socialism, and Progressivism
    - Tensions of class, immigration, and ethnic identity from the Gilded Age  spilled into the 20th century.
    - Progressivism was the response to tensions of the Gilded Age.
  - Women's movement in the early century
    - Referred to the "first wave" of feminists.
    - Women after 70 years of social ovement organizing, began to win major legislative victories.
  - Lecture will focus on race, gender, and class in the Progressivist movement.

### Jane Addams and the Hull House
- Jane Addams is a Chicago-based reformer that began the settlement house movement in the United States.
  - Adopted from a British tradition.
  - The Hull House settlement is her philanthropic project.
- Hull House was an attempt to address the forms of social inequality and poverty through voluntaristic and philanthropic means.
- Settlement houses, which appeared in every single major city, were tasked with amelerioating the communal working conditions that people found themselves in.
  - Based on women's activism.
  - Women couldn't vote; professional or middle-class women couldn't get an education.
- Many of these women became settlement house activists.
  - Developoed programs for hygiene and sanitation classes for working-class women, for example.
  - By facilitating cleanliness, reduced disease in the home.
  - Provided uplifting conditions for working-class women.
- The settlement house became somewhat of a community gathering place.
  - Could get access to free education, exposed to lectures on the arts, music, and other uplifting topics to pull people mentally out of the conditions of poverty.
  - Reorienting working people towards more refined sensibilities.
  - Done almost exclusively through philanthropic activities.
- Women solicited (or donated) to these large settlements to pay for teacher salaries, to build lecture halls, and other funding necessary.

#### Philanthropic Amelioration
- For example, would construct playgrounds for working-class children to play with.
  - Living coniditons in working-class communities are horid because they are right next to industrial facilities.
  - Specific sites could be designated to build play sites.

### Gender and Progressive Activism
- There are millions of people - thronged with immigrants.
- The limits of voluntaristic philanthropic efforts to address larger social questions became very clear.
- Discussion of early settlement house women was that one or two play structures could be built, but the government's support was needed.
- The only way to make these changes scale is for the government to operate them.
- WOmen's social role in this moment is being pushed into the poltiical sphere.
  - If one was confirmed with the condiiton of working-class people, quickly it becames a political issue that must be addressed politically.
- Nutrition in the home - if the mother's role is to provide for children, how can she do this in a society with expanding and unregulated food production?
  - Slaughterhouses of Chicago were not monitored and orutinely got people sick, causing consumer death and illness.
  - Consumers had no way to know if their food was rotten or diseased.
  - For women to have a scope of control over the domestic role, *she needed to at least have some say ito what the inputs to the household* were.
- These types of questions and the middle-class-activist role began to push outwards the boundaries of women's social participation in a much bigger way.
- In the late 19th and into the 20th century, this tied into broader movements.

#### Muller v. Oregon Brandeis Brief
- Came out of the Seneca Falls women's meeting that had been mobilizing for decades.
- These kinds of Progressive activists were able to link these: women needed votes such that they could act as the moral conscience in society.
  - The working conditions for hcildren, nutriiton, etc. needed to be regulated.
- If women's social task was to be the care-giver and the nurturer, in a place where work nad labor is being placed outisde the home, she needs to have a larger poltiical and social role.
- People for decades had been sturggling for hte 8-hour day, or other workplace limitations.
- The first set of those laws are set up for female workers.
- Many industrial workers were women; the first laws to enact limitations of hours of work were passed for *working women only*.
  - More than 10 hours of work was prohibited for women.
- Passed by cities and states; Oregon passes one of these laws but is sued.
  - Sued based on liberty of contract arguments.
- A laundry, which employed almost all women, in Oregon sues the state of Oregon.
  - THe state sues back that the laundry is violating the law.
  - Reaches the SUpreme Court becuase of the legal arguments of *Louis Brandeis*, a leading Progressive reformer and furture SUpreme Justice.
- Brandeis Brief: prepared by his cousin, a woman, who couldn't practice law.
  - He was made famous for this brief.
  - Argued a sociological, not a legal case, for why limits on women's work hours should exist.
  - There was no legal precedent for this case; up to decades at this point, liberty of contract was a cConsittutional guarantee.
- Brandeis developed an argument based on sociological sutdies about the health impacts of working large hours as it relates to pregnancy and other facets of owomens' lives.
  - It is deleterious to women's health to be working for more htan 10 hours, and thus it is in the interest of the public to impose a limitation.
- SUpreme Court ruled *in favor* of Brandies for the first time.
  - Crux of reasoning: 
    > "the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public itnerest and care in order to preserve the strength and rigor of the race."

### tHE wOMEN'S mOVEMENT
- an EMERGINg women's movement is comign to the fore, and is becoming increaasingly radicalized.
- Early effrots of reform were around amelerioating social condiitions, and for the vote - an extremely important part of the women's movement.
- Radical in the sense of questioning not onlyt he socialr oel of woemn as inherently more moral sex, and the whole framework - if this is the basis for which transformations to women's conditions is being made, it doesn't sound like equality.
- Crystal Eastman talking at the moment of the WOmen's MOvement's greatest triumph - it is only a place to begin for much further activism.
- SOme of the womena ctivists began calling themselves *feminists* from French groups.
- Began to challenge soicial orthodaoxy in a host of social makrers - like dress and gender presentations (what is abscribed to gender)?
- A small group of American women were calling themselves feminist; this carried out throughout the 20th century.

#### Votes for WOmen
- Eventually albe to win the vote, do it over the course of the war.
- THere are interesting and important stories there.

#### Birth Control
- One of the increasing parts of more radical demands: birth control.
- A social critique was that they were chained to their social roles as parents, unable to conrol when and how they had children.
- Access to regular birth control (before hormonal birth controls - instead, physical barriers like diaphrams or condoms).
- Emma Goldman - arrested repeatedly for giving speeches that violated obscenity laws.
- Goldman also promotted regular access to birth control, "free love".
  - A radical way to approaching women; not only "expanding the moral role" but rethinking the entire construction of women as being particularly moral.
  - A 16-year old Ukranian immigrant radicalized by the Haymarket Affair, began to read about anarchism and become a devotee of anarchist philosophers.

### How Progressive? Margaret Sanger and Eugenics
- Contradictions on progressivism; the other person promoting birth control is Margaret Sanger.
  - Margaret Sanger began the birth control organization that became planned parenthood.
- Promoting birth control for all of these reasons: saw women dying in childbirth, getting infections or bleed out because of lack of access to healthcare.
  - Saw that birth control was a way to address this if they could protect their reproductive health.
- Published and was arrested for obscenity laws.
- Also promoted arguments among eugenics and race purity for why access to birth control was important.
- If the doctrine of Social Darwinism was to be accepted, and some deserved to survive and others deserved not to: the poor, if given birth control, would not progress.
- Radicals like Emma Goldman are putting forth this outrageous visionn of what women's vision should be, whereas Sanger is approaching it from a more race-focused perspective, both pushing for the same thing.
- Alice Paul: argues for very interventionist militancy that becomes the fracture point.
  - When Paul was leading the suffrage movement, Ida B. Wells (black activist of the same period) wanted to be involved in the pageantry aspects.
  - Paul rejected Wells because she was black; that having Wells involved would draw attention and divert from the goal.
