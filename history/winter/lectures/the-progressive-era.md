### Introduction
- Introductory art: George Bellows, *New York*, 1911.
  - An emphasis on the light; buildings are illuminated across the plaza.
  - What is it like to be in a city in which massive skyscrapers cause large shafts of light to jut out between buildings.
  - Expresses the optimism and hope of progressive development and urbanism, yet the chaotic mess and swirl of the modern urban world without structure and regulation.
  - Comes from the *Ashcan* school tradition of art.
- The Guilded Age was filled with class conflict and violence; perhaps these tensions should be mitigated.
- **Contrast notions of "progress" at the turn of the century**
  - Central Questions: What factors make progressive social change possible? What is "progressive" social change? How important is social history, intellectual history, race, and class to understand the progressive era?
  - Jim Crow in American society
    - Jim Crow was slowly built over decades of rolling back black political empowerment and constructing and reinforcing white supremacy in law.
    - Entrenched racial segregation and racial conceptions of progressivism.
  - The Social Question, socialism, and Progressivism
    - Tensions of class, immigration, and ethnic identity from the Gilded Age spilled into the 20th century.
    - Progressivism was the response to tensions of the Gilded Age.
  - Women's movement in the early century
    - Referred to the "first wave" of feminists.
    - Women after 70 years of social movement organizing, began to win major legislative victories.
  - Lecture will focus on race, gender, and class in the Progressivist movement.

### Jane Addams and the Hull House
- Jane Addams is a Chicago-based reformer that began the settlement house movement in the United States.
  - Adopted from a British tradition.
  - The Hull House settlement is her philanthropic project.
- Hull House was an attempt to address the forms of social inequality and poverty through voluntaristic and philanthropic means.
- Settlement houses, which appeared in every single major city, were tasked with ameliorating the communal working conditions that people found themselves in.
  - Based on women's activism.
  - Women couldn't vote; professional or middle-class women couldn't get an education.
- Many of these women became settlement house activists.
  - Developed programs for hygiene and sanitation classes for working-class women, for example.
  - By facilitating cleanliness, reduced disease in the home.
  - Provided uplifting conditions for working-class women.
- The settlement house became somewhat of a community gathering place.
  - Could get access to free education, exposed to lectures on the arts, music, and other uplifting topics to pull people mentally out of the conditions of poverty.
  - Reorienting working people towards more refined sensibilities.
  - Done almost exclusively through philanthropic activities.
- Women solicited (or donated) to these large settlements to pay for teacher salaries, to build lecture halls, and other funding necessary.

#### Philanthropic Amelioration
- For example, would construct playgrounds for working-class children to play with.
  - Living conditions in working-class communities are horrid because they are right next to industrial facilities.
  - Specific sites could be designated to build play sites.

<br>

<br>

### Gender and Progressive Activism
- There are millions of people - thronged with immigrants.
- The limits of voluntaristic philanthropic efforts to address larger social questions became very clear.
- Discussion of early settlement house women was that one or two play structures could be built, but the government's support was needed.
- The only way to make these changes scale is for the government to operate them.
- Women's social role at this moment is being pushed into the political sphere.
  - If one was confirmed with the condition of working-class people, quickly it becomes a political issue that must be addressed politically.
- Nutrition in the home - if the mother's role is to provide for children, how can she do this in a society with expanding and unregulated food production?
  - Slaughterhouses of Chicago were not monitored and routinely got people sick, causing consumer death and illness.
  - Consumers had no way to know if their food was rotten or diseased.
  - For women to have a scope of control over the domestic role, *she needed to at least have some say in what the inputs to the household* were.
- These types of questions and the middle-class-activist role began to push outwards the boundaries of women's social participation in a much bigger way.
- In the late 19th and into the 20th century, this tied into broader movements.

#### Muller v. Oregon Brandeis Brief
- Came out of the Seneca Falls women's meeting that had been mobilizing for decades.
- These kinds of Progressive activists were able to link these: women needed votes such that they could act as the moral conscience in society.
  - The working conditions for children, nutrition, etc. needed to be regulated.
- If a women's social task was to be the care-giver and the nurturer, in a place where work and labor are being placed outside the home, she needs to have a larger political and social role.
- People for decades had been struggling for the 8-hour day or other workplace limitations.
- The first set of those laws are set up for female workers.
- Many industrial workers were women; the first laws to enact limitations of hours of work were passed for *working women only*.
  - More than 10 hours of work was prohibited for women.
- Passed by cities and states; Oregon passes one of these laws but issued.
  - Sued based on liberty of contract arguments.
- A laundry, which employed almost all women, in Oregon sues the state of Oregon.
  - The state sues back that the laundry is violating the law.
  - Reaches the Supreme Court because of the legal arguments of *Louis Brandeis*, a leading Progressive reformer and future Supreme Justice.
- Brandeis Brief: prepared by his cousin, a woman, who couldn't practice law.
  - He was made famous for this brief.
  - Argued a sociological, not a legal case, for why limits on women's work hours should exist.
  - There was no legal precedent for this case; up to decades at this point, liberty of contract was a constitutional guarantee.
- Brandeis developed an argument based on sociological studies about the health impacts of working large hours as it relates to pregnancy and other facets of women's' lives.
  - It is deleterious to women's health to be working for more than 10 hours, and thus it is in the interest of the public to impose a limitation.
- Supreme Court ruled *in favor* of Brandies for the first time.
  - Crux of reasoning: 
    > "the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of public interest and care to preserve the strength and rigor of the race."

### tHE wOMEN'S mOVEMENT
- an EMERGINg women's movement is coming to the fore and is becoming increasingly radicalized.
- Early efforts of reform were around ameliorating social conditions, and for the vote - an extremely important part of the women's movement.
- Radical in the sense of questioning not only the social model of women as inherently more moral sex, and the whole framework - if this is the basis for which transformations to women's conditions are being made, it doesn't sound like equality.
- Crystal Eastman talking at the moment of the Women's Movement's greatest triumph - it is only a place to begin for much further activism.
- Some of the women activists began calling themselves *feminists* from French groups.
- Began to challenge social orthodoxy in a host of social markers - like a dress and gender presentations (what is ascribed to gender)?
- A small group of American women were calling themselves feminist; this carried out throughout the 20th century.

#### Votes for WOmen
- Eventually able to win the vote, do it throughout the war.
- There are interesting and important stories there.

#### Birth Control
- One of the increasing parts of more radical demands: birth control.
- A social critique was that they were chained to their social roles as parents, unable to control when and how they had children.
- Access to regular birth control (before hormonal birth controls - instead, physical barriers like diaphragms or condoms).
- Emma Goldman - arrested repeatedly for giving speeches that violated obscenity laws.
- Goldman also promoted regular access to birth control, "free love".
  - A radical way to approaching women; not only "expanding the moral role" but rethinking the entire construction of women as being particularly moral.
  - A 16-year old Ukranian immigrant radicalized by the Haymarket Affair, began to read about anarchism and become a devotee of anarchist philosophers.

### How Progressive? Margaret Sanger and Eugenics
- Contradictions on progressivism; the other person promoting birth control is Margaret Sanger.
  - Margaret Sanger began the birth control organization that became planned parenthood.
- Promoting birth control for all of these reasons: saw women dying in childbirth, getting infections, or bleed out because of lack of access to healthcare.
  - Saw that birth control was a way to address this if they could protect their reproductive health.
- Published and was arrested for obscenity laws.
- Also promoted arguments among eugenics and race purity for why access to birth control was important.
- If the doctrine of Social Darwinism was to be accepted, and some deserved to survive and others deserved not to the poor, if given birth control, would not progress.
- Radicals like Emma Goldman are putting forth this outrageous vision of what women's vision should be, whereas Sanger is approaching it from a more race-focused perspective, both pushing for the same thing.
- Alice Paul argues for very interventionist militancy that becomes the fracture point.
  - When Paul was leading the suffrage movement, Ida B. Wells (black activist of the same period) wanted to be involved in the pageantry aspects.
  - Paul rejected Wells because she was black; that having Wells involved would draw attention and divert from the goal.

### Economic Ruin in the South
- Contradictions emerging around contradictions of progressivism and pushing the "envelope"; even in common parlance identified as progressive.
- Around this is a thinking that is difficult to call progressive.
- Rise of Jim Crow and the rise of lynch law
- US is continually remaking its racial policy; gives rise to new forms of racial hierarchy and oppression.
- Structures are being conscientiously made and are one of the main contradictions on Progressive ideology.
- Economic devastation of the South was very totalizing, and it never recovers; it continues to struggle.
- Because of very little Reconstruction that occurs, only a few cities (e.g. Georgia, Birmingham) emerge.
  - For example, for textile manufacturing, coal, or intersection of railroads.

### Triumph of Redemption
- White supremacist groups that pushed out black officials and gained power in every Southern state; began developing reconstruction programs.
- Progressive taxation that had emerged in Reconstruction became undone.
- The attack on public schools and other public infrastructure harmed poor whites as well.

#### Roll Back of Black Political Rights
- Restrictions on political rights make gaining access to power and the electoral college very difficult.

#### The Rise of Segregation
- Legislating *social interaction*.
- Once black people were disenfranchised politically, it became possible to pass laws to restrict social interaction.
  - For example, cannot use the same doorways, streetcars, or sidewalks.
- Marks a legislative shift in a way that had never really happened before.
- Results in the era of Jim Crow segregation.
- Sets the stage for much of the 20th-century struggle.

#### The Supreme Court
- The federal system has supremacy; federal law supersedes federal law.
- In the wake of the Civil War, radical Republicans passed a variety of laws.
  - For example, the Civil Rights Act and Constitutional amendments require equal protection before the law.
- Because of this, people attempted to test Southern segregation laws as a violation of Constitutional principles and amendments.
- Activists set up legal challenges to push back against newly emerging sets of racial legislation in the South.
- Homer Plessy decided to test the public transit segregation of railroads in 1895-1896 by riding a train into the South.
  - Trains needed to be segregated after cars entered Southern states.
  - Plessy hired a private agency to arrest him such that the Supreme Court could decide on it.
- *Plessy v. Ferguson*: separate but equal.
  - Advent of a new system; was being *made*. Where is the legal founding upon which this ruling can be made?
  - Distinction between the social and the political; if they want to impose racial hierarchy, they must develop a contrivance to address that legally.
  - By making a distinction between social and political - arguing that the amendment applies *politically* - it can be argued social relationships should be segregated.
  - This segregation now has federal legal backing for the entire nation, not just in the south.
- 1896 - a wave of violence in the South in the aftermath of this ruling.
  - Segregation is legally justifiable, but vigilante groups can now enforce segregation with violence.

### The Rise of Lynching
- 1825-1930s; usually, a black person is accused of a crime.
- They are arrested, broken out of the jail by a mob, taken sometimes by small groups or in large groups in the middle of the night secretively.
- Tortures and executes them.

#### Sam HOse
- 5,000 lynchings (and others unrecorded) have been recorded by magazines.
- It is known from the newspapers; the Sam Hose case around the 1900s.
- Sam Hose was a laborer who was working for someone who refused to give him time-off requests.
- Are involved in a physical altercation; Sam Hose strikes his employer and kills him.
- Sam Hose knows he will face lynching and cannot turn himself to the police (will be broken out), so he flees and tries to get out of the state.
- While he is leaving, word of the killing gets out; comingling with the rumor is that he raped a white woman (invented).
- Is eventually spotted on a train and taken by a mob where he is tortured before he is killed.
  - Torture involves *flaying* - removing portions of his skin, as well as cutting off body parts like ears, fingers, and genitals, burning; then killed.
  - People took souvenirs from his body; W.E. du Bois later found pieces of his body for sale.
- Poses questions and problems; begs why questions.
  - What is this *level* of violence and horror?
  - How is this explained?

<br>

### Ida B. Wells and the Black Intellectual Tradition
- Performs qualitative and quantitative evaluations of newspaper lynchings in the South; looks into individual cases to see what is happening.
- Three people Wells knew in Tennessee had been lynched; their grocery store competed with a white-owned monopoly and was lynched.
- Wells concluded those being lynched were ones pushing the boundaries of Jim Crow segregation.
  - Found themselves to be targets of this kind of violence.
  - Performed a detailed account of raping white women; in almost all cases, it was unfounded and used to justify the horrific violence.
- Wells asserted there were consensual sexual relationships between white women and black men.
  - Claims of rape were happening in established by illicit interracial relations.
- Black women and white people were also lynched.
  - Regardless, overwhelmingly black men were lynched.
- Wells develops the phenomenon of lynching; Southern officials are not investigating.
  - Sometimes, Southern officials participate in the lynching.
  - In some instances, sheriffs are responsible for handing people off to lynch mobs.
- A social movement is being created around this.

### NAACP and Movements for Reform
- In the NAACP, founded in 1909, their primary campaign was around lynching.
- A newspaper publicized every lynching they found out about.
- Wells was prevented from sitting on the board of the NAACP; continued the tradition to uncover "lynch law".
- Their approach was that the legal basis of equality was present in the United States, but it needed to be enforced.
  - Integration and other measures needed to be done so in the existing political and economic framework.
- Attempted to directly challenge racial supremacy.
- Others had completely different approaches: Booker T. Washington
  - Washington argued that changes for equality did not look promising.
  - Instead, a strong economic condition could be built for, and the welfare could be developed in that way.
  - Washington argued not to push the envelope.
- Marcus Garvey
  - Argued the question of equality would *never* be possible.
  - Advocated for black nationalism, which was the notion of constructing a new and separate nation.
  - Attempted to found the economic basis for a new political identity.
- Intellectually, many ways to seek redress or thinking how to navigate white supremacy.

### Migrations
- Many decided to leave; between 1910-1930, the "First Great Migration" occurs.
  - Black people, in 1s and 2s but also families, move north.
  - 1.3 million people left the south in the first wave.
  - Transformed neighborhoods like Harlem that become overwhelmingly black.
  - Primarily because of racial covenants - for instance, black people could not own homes above a certain street.
  
#### The North: 1919 Chicago Race Riot
- In 1919, there is one of the largest race riots in the United States.
- Chicago had segregated beaches.
- In the summer of 1919, a child swims across the segregated line in the water.
  - The white crowd is outraged and attempts to kill the child.
  - The mob turns into Chicago and begins pulling black people off of railroad cars and attacks them in the street.
- Results in the killing of 38 people in a riot that lasted several days.
- Was not only confined to an area.

#### American Racial Fabric
- Emerging is a fabric of racial structuring that permeates society.
- In the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan is resurgent.
- High school yearbooks from certain states have KKK clubs.
- 1922 march with thousands of Klan members marching in the capitol in a show of political strength.
- In 1916, Woodrow Wilson is a leading Progressive that invites a leading segregationist.
  - Invites screening of films that valorize the formation of the Klan.
  - Widespread and highly contradictory.
- Contradictions in the progressive era; progressive reforms are changing the shape of the nation in a contradictory and complex way.
- It helps us think about defining what this phenomenon of Progressivism is.
