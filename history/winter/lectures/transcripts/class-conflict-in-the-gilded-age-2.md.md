## Transcript for Part of *Class Conflict in the Guilded Age* Day 2

```
Such that those who are not with us can just get
00:07
What we're about to do.
00:12
And I'll post that on the canvas site a little bit later.
00:20
But yeah, glad to see everybody
00:24
Let's get started.
00:35
We're talking about the Gilded Age.
00:39
And we were using Jacob Reese as a way to sort of get the feeling the sense of what people were thinking about and talking about around the emergence of class divides
00:53
In the late
00:55
19th century emergence, you know, but we we can talk about this. Yeah, maybe transformation, right, because it's like did did classes or class divisions not exist before.
01:10
Well, no, of course not. Like, if we look at what he Holton, or anyone else. Yes, there are different sets of interests that are
01:19
influencing how people act collectively and politically, but they're just sort of changing in the Gilded Age.
01:28
And
01:31
You know, a society with
01:35
Extremely disparate sets of access to wealth and income and income inequality was a transformation and how those people were making
01:46
And collecting their wealth was also something different, something new, partially about way to this partially about all these other things. So we're looking at this transformation and we were using the story of the Haymarket affair to sort of get into
02:05
Many of those themes and the experience of Albert and Lucy parson says they come to industrializing Chicago experience some of that inequality first hand.
02:20
Experience these cycles of economic boom and bust the growth, the hands depression.
02:29
And radicalize eventually becoming
02:34
Anarchists becoming involved in the
02:39
fairly robust
02:44
And and i might add reformist labor movement.
02:49
movement that was looking to address some of the most glaring aspects of the inequality of the new system.
02:58
And then out of those sets of struggles political tensions political questions emerged pretty violent conflict, very quickly police officers are killing striking workers.
03:11
Unknown persons, but people affiliated with the labor movement, presumably are killing police officers in
03:21
retaliation or revenge. If we're to believe the revenge circular that
03:29
Was produced
03:31
And
03:33
And then the the legal structure of the of Chicago is put to use on really supporting the ability of these labor organizations and radical organizations to
03:51
Continue to function in Chicago. The trial is not just against these eight individuals but like their ability to publish and print and and be politically active
04:05
The trial ends and execution for some of them, and then it led us to the series of questions that we were
04:14
Attempting to grapple with at the end of the last session, not just on the social question here, we see, you know, tremendous poverty immigrants movements, bringing radicalism and sort of a home grown anarchist tradition in the Parsons.
04:36
Really forcing these larger social questions on society is this is this
04:44
Worthy democratic institutions at the foundation of the country democratic at the foundation of the country. Were they able to survive these
04:56
Types of transformations. Was this form of conflict now inherent to modern society, and what could be done with it.
05:08
And the other question is about the role of the state itself. And we had talked about this, that, you know, a major purveyor of the violence here is government is in the form of the police or the court system.
05:25
Or
05:28
Something else.
05:29
So, um, so that question of, what would the role of government be in this conflict, how, how would it navigate this new sort of modern social and political
05:46
Terrain wasn't wasn't abiding question in the in the period and their debates about it.
05:55
Be because we had talked a little bit about radicalism and radicalization, there were certainly those in the workers movement like the
06:05
The Parsons, who are anarchists who thought that the State could have no role. So not only were they emerging as socialists economically, meaning they saw the root of this problem between, you know, poverty and wealth and
06:26
In inequitable treatment for people who are working in the factories and so forth as rooted in capitalism, but they also didn't see the state as a solution and they saw it as a as a
06:43
contributing to the problem and perpetually contributing to the problem. So,
06:52
It wasn't just that employers had control over the workplaces. It's that they could use
06:58
The gap, the police, the government, the Army than the
07:03
All of these institutions could be used to enforce employers.
07:09
Will our ability to control their property at the expense of working people. So here the state isn't going to function in the interests of
07:22
Regular people but that that would always be true if you were to have a worker state.
07:30
Like many of us in the socialist movements were calling for or like, hey, what if we elected all workers or we had a socialist government or they said that would continue that process of repression and would lead to
07:49
Other forms of inequality that also want to be helpful.
07:55
So,
07:56
A real
07:58
What shall we say hotbed of radicalism.
08:02
And this you know it's interesting because I'm often
08:10
You know the law of unexpected consequences. Obviously the Chicago Police Force and judiciary and legal system was attempting to you know put an end to the ability of radicals to
08:29
Organize and and put pressure for the eight hour day, for example, or other things but
08:37
Actually had the opposite effect, it led to a flowering of radicalism, not just in the United States but globally. The the
08:48
Internationally recognized day of workers is may 1 because of this the Haymarket affair. It's not practiced in the United States because it was essentially
09:01
Forgotten rubbed out forgotten with the first and second Red Scare in the 20th century, but everywhere else in the world celebrates may 1 as a as a workers day and in commemoration of those who were
09:17
Executed as part of this trial.
09:20
So, it led to like this global sort of
09:25
radicalization, but also radicalization in the United States. Many people were very closely following the trial and future American radicals. People like Emma Goldman, who was a young
09:42
I'm not sure if she was Ukrainian or high Russian. But in any case, young Russian immigrant to
09:50
To the United States and future.
09:54
extremely famous radical anarchist was radicalized by the trial her following of the trial as a 15 or 16 year old really just set her path on
10:12
Towards the politics of the Haymarket martyrs.
10:18
Okay.
10:20
So that's a market but hey market if you will believe it is just the tip of the iceberg week I could have picked
10:31
A dozen other incidents in the late 19th century in which there were similar forms of
10:41
Class violence and class conflict. Hey market is one of the more famous but it's not the only one.
10:49
And so I want to talk a little bit about the context that is is producing that and part of this is being driven by the second Industrial Revolution.
11:02
You may recall, we talked about the first industrial revolution with law and to teach this in schools anymore, do you know about the difference between the first and second Industrial Revolution. Is that a thing or is it just like the Industrial Revolution happened and
user avatar
Unknown Speaker
11:22
That's it.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
11:27
No one knows about the First and Second Industrial Revolution. Okay. Well, now we're in the second, the first, you know, if we're thinking about, oh yeah, Krishna.
user avatar
Krishna P.
11:38
I think the difference was between the second Industrial Revolution.
11:43
Started to use electricity.
11:46
And I'd seen colon stuff as we sit power automating machinery.
11:51
Whereas I think the beginnings of the first Industrial Revolution used like water, and either manpower through uses of machines. So I think the output of machines increase in Second Industrial Revolution. Yeah.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
12:09
And power sources, a big part of that. So if you recall the law.
12:13
mills are being powered through water ways through water power. The second Industrial Revolution is being powered through fossil fuels, coal, mostly
12:25
And the ability to produce the invention of the the
12:32
Bessemer steel mill and the ability to like mass produce
12:37
Steel and transform machinery. The other thing you might remember about law is that many of the early the power looms that they were using is made of wood.
12:49
And all of a sudden, all of this machinery has been transformed
12:53
Into steel and other forms of metal work. So it's a huge
12:59
It's a significant
13:01
Change in particular the shift in the power source in the use of fossil fuels, maybe one of the most momentous decisions in all of human history.
13:12
But it's
13:14
And it really actually gets a jumpstart in the
13:19
In the Civil War, the Civil War government contracts for
13:26
Certainly for weapons and, you know,
13:32
Well, well, we can just take weapons.
13:36
weapons were then being mass produced in an assembly line style for the first time, with the advent of the Civil War.
13:48
So rifles.
13:51
Were you know before would be made by like a craftsman, you sort of craft this whole piece and sell it, but
14:00
The interchangeable parts on rifles was the early forms of mechanized
14:08
Production
14:10
That was another part of this of this transformation.
14:17
But the main
14:20
The main engine so to speak of this transformation is the
14:26
railroad industry.
14:29
And for both the industrial revolutions, you know, the advent of an engine of some kind, the steam engine.
14:40
Which was initially used in mining to like pump water as it was invented in the, I think the 18th century, the 1790s.
14:50
But it soon became clear that that engine could be applied to
14:58
All kinds of different forms of production to drive machinery, for example, or for transportation in like river boats pictured here the leftover
15:12
Or
15:14
For railroads.
15:18
And railroads become a leading
15:25
You know they're they're the tech industry of the 19th century. They're the they're the most sophisticated most highly capitalized most politically dominant
15:37
Industry in the 1870s 80s and 90s stock market frenzies and booms and busts are built on
15:46
You know, pouring capital to fund these competing railroads, who are attempting to establish as much track over the, over the country as they possibly could. The railroad firms themselves required huge capitalization.
16:05
Oh yes with it.
user avatar
Vivek P
16:07
I'm just wondering, in the end, what caused kind of the decline of the railroad industry.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
16:17
Amazing book on this.
16:19
That to service used to read ahead hate
16:24
I think, was it the least favorite book Sophia, or is it after
user avatar
Sophia L Carey
16:29
That and the lumber one I think might have been time
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
16:34
Yeah, there's a there's a book about railroads that is pretty snarky
16:41
It's by this historian who used to be at U. Dub and it's now at Stanford, Richard white. It's called railroaded
16:49
And it's about the advent and development of this industry and he has a very
16:57
negative view of the whole industry and the whole process and the individuals who are responsible for this and he puts a lot of the fault for the decline of the railroads.
17:10
On the railroads. So many people say, well, the automobile. The advent of interstate trucking and the interstate highway system that enabled goods to be moved without
17:26
You know, outside of railroads ruined the railroad system, but he says the fault is to be found in the system itself then. And one of the things he points to. And one of the things that people wrote about at the time, is this thing called ruinous competition.
17:46
And the idea here was
17:50
That, well let's. What's an example.
17:59
railroad companies are attempting to like
18:03
They want to monopolize the freight traffic for any region right they want to develop
18:13
Their line into a region that would be highly, you know, had lots of production or exchange happening there, such that they could be hauling hauling the freight.
18:24
Well, not all regions are equally competitive. So developing tracks, you know, into some areas is going to be wasteful, but maybe you do it still to get the monopoly just such that you're the first one out there.
18:41
Or maybe there's already a track into a profitable area, but you want to cut into your competitions market. So you built another track like close to it that you can then compete with oh yes Austin inside of him.
user avatar
Austin Paul Shaw [ɒstɪn pɔːl ʃɑo]
18:56
Isn't this what happened with Cape like internet cable today.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
19:02
Well,
19:03
What do you mean
user avatar
Austin Paul Shaw [ɒstɪn pɔːl ʃɑo]
19:04
Like, like in the like in the cable and internet industry, we have in like rural areas where cable is very much an economical wheel. We usually only see like one or two providers and even then they only they only a half faster job at doing cable and
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
19:22
Right.
19:23
Yeah. Similar, you can see you can see parallel. And then in other areas, you have
19:28
railroad lines competing with each other. So if one firm builds a track and then another firm builds a track close then they have to compete to get that same traffic.
19:39
And the way you do that is by lowering your rates. So you say okay all Hall for five cents less than you do.
19:46
And then the other person starts losing all of their business and they say, Damn, okay all Hall for five cents less than them.
19:53
In this process of competition in which both firms then become bankrupt.
20:03
Because maybe if you're a huge national firm, maybe you can run this line under costs and are making money similar outs. But if you make enough of those decisions to run under cost, you're not you're not making any money.
20:19
And so firms were going bankrupt.
20:23
Left and right and this book sort of Chronicles, that whole that whole process and then really villain Isis, the railroad barons, as they were called the leading millionaires who own these firms for developing this harmful strategy.
20:47
But nonetheless, they could part of the process was that and the reason why bankruptcies would come is because
20:55
These firms had to be highly capitalized like it was extremely expensive to create a railroad mine and trains and all of these things, just take tons of capital.
21:07
And so it was you had to spend all of this money at the outset in order to think about getting returns over the long term from the freight that would that would be
21:20
That would be shipped.
21:23
And that huge capital meant that you were having to pay back loans and if you were
21:31
Engaging and so called ruin his competition. You weren't seeing the return that you needed to pay back that that capitalization. And so bankruptcies were rife sort of all along the
21:46
Here's a map of the First Transcontinental you can see
21:51
Oh, really interesting and somewhat horrible history of that.
21:56
The other thing that makes railroads possible. And indeed, much of the process of industrialization is the role of the state. The state was giving railroad companies.
22:09
Massive land grants enormous swath of land in order to build their railroad lines, they would give them often 100 miles of land on either side.
22:26
Of a track that they were planning to make with the idea that the railroads could build the track it would then be more attractive for settlement say for farmers.
22:39
Right, because you could grow and then have access to the railroad, which would give you access to markets all across the nation into the rest of the world. So the railroads could sell those lands as part of their
22:56
As part of their
22:59
Profit model basically to help them survive as well as all kinds of other
23:06
Incentives gifs low or no tax incentives regions would compete with each other like cities would compete. Are we going to run the railroad line through, you know, Ellen's Berg or Yakima
23:25
Well Yakima, what are you going to give us
23:29
What, what kinds of incentives, can you can you make it enticing for us to bring our line through your, your
23:38
City and same thing in like the Pacific Northwest was the terminus to be port Townsend on the peninsula, like with the major city be
23:48
Fully across the sound and really into the farthest western region of the state, or was it to be Seattle or Tacoma, for example, right, these
23:59
cities and states were competing with each other to entice the companies to place
24:06
Their track through their
24:09
City. And so, giving them all kinds of local incentives, as well as the federal incentives. These land grants that you can see in these
24:20
In these maps. So really significant amounts of land are being
24:25
Given to the
24:30
Companies. Yes, Mark.
user avatar
Mark Pock
24:39
Okay, quick question. Did they have a
24:42
local or federal property tax at the time.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
24:47
There were property taxes.
24:52
I don't know enough about those like local history of how that's been developed.
24:57
Not at the federal level.
25:01
But there were local property taxes.
25:05
Yeah, good question. Why, why are you thinking about that or what, what do you think
user avatar
Mark Pock
25:09
It just because of the immense amount of lands that's being here. I feel like at least in the modern day would be completely ruin us for someone to just own that much lands, let alone actually like just maintain it as strikers somewhere on the west side. Right. Yeah.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
25:25
It would be really expensive to hold but as like
25:28
A form of speculation. Basically, you can get gifted this land and then parcel it out and sell it out, a lot of it was sold to in the Pacific Northwest. It was sold to
25:41
The, the timber firms of
25:45
Minnesota
25:47
Wisconsin and Michigan, Michigan.
25:51
Like weyerhauser that then became predominantly Pacific Northwest firms as as the central part was denuded of trees.
26:01
So you could you could try to spin it.
26:05
Spin it off, so to speak.
26:08
About
user avatar
Unknown Speaker
26:13
Krishna.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
26:15
Krishna.
user avatar
Krishna P.
26:17
I was just wondering. So certifications state do these cards plots of land free or was it sold our companies.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
26:26
Yeah, yeah. Free yeah huge here, please. We're trying to develop commerce and industry and exchange HERE TO USE USE THIS
26:39
We want to Transcontinental Railroad. We want access into the ranching hinterlands of the Dakotas, not really. Nobody really wanted that. But we want access to the timber lands of the Pacific Northwest, or whatever, California agricultural fields.
26:59
Yes, please take this slide.
user avatar
Annabella Li
27:06
So the map on the top right, but
27:12
I'm assuming it's also like between the land grants.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
27:16
For your tracks. Yeah.
user avatar
Annabella Li
27:18
Um, so what's the
27:23
So what would the land grants only
27:27
Like in the West, almost without I'm looking at it and it's
27:32
Like empty.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
27:34
I don't know why they're the East Coast isn't marked on this map, you know, much of the the land grant process happens in in the so again the civil wars like this incubator for all of this stuff.
27:50
Those are initiated in the Civil War and the transcontinental project was also initiated in civil war and
28:01
So that might be why it's been featured like this much of the East Coast had, in particular the Northeast had developed
28:13
I forget what the count was they were developing something like 7000 miles of track a year.
28:21
In in that early period and much of that was happening in the East Coast already so maybe I'm not sure that's really good question. That was already a foot are already being taken care of and so federal land grants are happening, like in the territories to the west.
28:39
I don't know. That's really good question.
28:49
Okay, so it real estate. What are they doing. Yeah, providing huge grants and other subsidies.
28:58
For these
29:01
Corporations
29:03
Being driven by railroads.
29:06
This leads to the largest industrial fortunes in human history, an enormous creation of wealth and we should say wealth inequality wealth at the top.
29:24
And the leading figures for this are often these two people john Rockefeller on the left and Andrew Carnegie on the right. Interestingly, they were not
29:38
Railroad barons.
29:41
But worked in sort of ancillary industries Rockefeller and oil.
29:49
And Carnegie in steel.
29:54
Rockefeller interestingly also got his start in the Civil War with government contracts that he was using around manufacturing, but quickly from there transitioned into oil production and there are many regions in the US that are very oil rich
30:15
And
30:17
And Rockefeller essentially created his
30:23
Are you how familiar. Is everybody with business theory.
30:27
Like, are you familiar with vertical and horizontal integration.
30:33
Yes, often
user avatar
Austin Paul Shaw [ɒstɪn pɔːl ʃɑo]
30:36
Well on vertical and horizontal integration is essentially where you try to know. So let's just take a look at the
30:44
At essentially the essentially the economy, you take the raw product. There's, there's a one sector of business that takes her our product processes processes into it into a process number into like process product number one.
31:00
Another like
31:01
You know, I'm going to use the analogy of the automotive industry as an example here. For example, well one company a mind still lithium used in batteries. Another company up packages that into batteries and other company.
31:15
And us another process essentially makes batteries into battery packs and other the automotive manufacturer installs that battery pack on the vehicle.
31:24
Well, what
31:25
What what essentially a horizontal integration is is effectively like your, your lithium minor you buy all the lithium, mind you essentially monopolize the monopolized
31:36
Lithium industry and create massive products or you buy all the automotive manufacturers monopolize the automotive market to create massive products vertical integration is where you try to occupy
31:50
A large, large continuous chain of supply, I think this is, I think, Tesla is referred to in the media as doing this day they make that they they make their own batteries, they make their own battery packs make their own cars and I think they're getting into the mining industry.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
32:09
Exactly. So vertical is the entire process of production from the raw material extraction refinement processing manufacturing assembly and retail selling warehousing Krishna.
user avatar
Krishna P.
32:23
Just related to acquisitions of businesses are creating new businesses to compete with others.
32:29
A little bit above
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
32:30
You can
32:31
You can purchase. So say Rockefeller gets involved in the oil extraction industry, as he does in the mining in the actual sinking of wells.
32:44
And pulling oil up out of the earth. Well, he quickly finds that these tam railroad companies are ripping him off because they have, they
32:55
Have monopolized the track and are charging him so much money to then ship the oil out of wherever it's mind to to where it needs to be refined. So by the railroad company, and then it gets to the refinery, and the refineries are ripping them off. So purchase the refinery.
33:13
And then on the refinery. And then when it comes time to sell the oil. These marketers and the retail establishments are marking it up and and he's not seen any of that profit so purchase the retail outlets like standard
33:29
Oil.
33:30
retail outlets so you can just purchase or make right
33:37
Develop spin off create so so Rockefeller use that model and which is called vertical integration and at one point in the late 19th century controlled 90% of the oil market in the entirety of the country. I mean in terms of
33:56
Monopoly control just unprecedented control also the origination of the Monopoly game, which is that anyway. All of these things are coming out of this, but
34:09
So total near complete monopolistic control of a whole industry vertically integrated Carnegie. On the other hand, tried the other model that Austin was talking about, which is to own
34:24
All of or as many of a single part of the industrial process as he could not the like extraction and shipping and all of those pieces but just steel manufacturing
34:39
And similarly,
34:41
He created the largest us American
34:49
Manufacturing Company.
34:51
At the time he had the US Steel. It was the first company valued at a billion dollars. So the, so we even at this early stage are transitioning out of millionaires and hundred millionaires into fortunes worth
35:09
Billions of dollars and
35:14
Yeah.
35:15
These guys are very rich
35:20
What else do we need to say about that. I don't know.
35:25
Why, what
35:28
What were the conditions.
35:31
What were the conditions for working people.
35:36
I'm not good.
35:39
So, oh, is this a hand Annabel
user avatar
Annabella Li
35:43
It was about the picture on the last slide of like the octopus.
user avatar
Unknown Speaker
35:47
Oh, yeah.
user avatar
Unknown Speaker
35:52
Wait, you said
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
35:55
Shall we count the legs 127 I see seven
36:02
Maybe last one.
36:06
Yeah, what's your, what are you thinking, what's your question.
user avatar
Annabella Li
36:09
I was just wondering what exactly it's
36:13
Like my initial thought would be. It's like a representation of maybe the monopolies that big companies like strangling
36:24
Building and kind of people
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
36:29
Lily, did you, did you have a hand with this about this.
36:33
Or is this a different question.
user avatar
Lily
36:36
Similar comment.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
36:37
Okay. Yeah. Would you go
user avatar
Lily
36:39
I was just like the same thing as a developer
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
36:44
Yeah, I mean, it's a little bit hard to see because it's small here but
36:48
If you'll see labeled on the top. What, what is the
36:53
What's the object that the octopuses merged with what's that cylindrical thing.
user avatar
Austin Paul Shaw [ɒstɪn pɔːl ʃɑo]
37:01
Arrow.
user avatar
Michael Beyea Reagan
37:03
Yeah, a
37:07
I don't know if they have these around here in California where I grew up, you would see them all across the landscape. Next to refineries, but it's an oil tanker. It's like a storage tanker
37:20
For oil, you could hold it in a fixed fixed tanker, and it's labeled Standard Oil at the top and substandard oil was Rockefellers oil company.
37:33
And what are the tentacles doing
37:40
A little bit hard to see.

Seems like a chokehold on government institutions, as if they have power control with the lawmakers buildings any laws that come forward and like the president is just watching over as he falls into this too soon for the White House.

Yeah, the White House is in the lower left here, this building a tentacle approaching
38:13
Yes, Lily.

Lily
38:18
Um, you know, yanking them into his domain.

Michael Beyea Reagan
38:22
Exactly. These people at the top, who are distraught maybe competitors.
38:27
Or maybe consumers who are getting screwed over or whatever. Yes.
38:33
I love this phrase, you know, linking them into his domain that is that is accurate and and also sort of gets at this idea of like is modernity compatible with democracy like are the institutions of democracy as they were constructed in the pre pre industrial capitalist period right
38:59
Pre industrial capitalism. These forms of government are being constructed, can they survive this enormous social transformation that is coming with
39:10
industrial capitalism and these huge fortunes and the ability for monopolistic market control like no one, you know, Smith and others were not thinking that this was a possibility. So here's the enormous transformation.
39:29
conditions of labor.
39:32
They were
39:34
Not good. Oh, Lily. I'm sorry. Yeah.
39:41
Although your handles from before. Okay. My bad.
39:44
conditions of labor. Not good. So while the state was sort of taking action to spur in advance and facilitate industrial processes in this way.
39:57
And not taking action to mitigate wealth inequality or thinking about, you know, whatever tax as a redistributed effort or anything like this. So they're facilitating not only the growth of fortunes, but also the success of these industries.
40:17
Workers had no similar protections and as we talked about this either in the manufacturing process like in the work itself or in terms of like home and consumer
40:31
You know, consumer questions so
40:36
Let's see. Well, if we take just one figure
40:41
And the figures are hard to come by. Because it's not like there were very precise studies being done.
40:46
But it's been estimated that 35,000 people are being killed in industrial accidents in workplaces every year in the Gilded Age. So the
40:58
The growth of these factories that are being geared towards like profit maximization competition and market control are not considering the, the human conditions in which the people who are doing the work.
41:12
And so every industry faces all kinds of really horrifying industrial accidents, if you think about that in my name in terms of
41:25
Collapse minds as mining companies attempt to quickly get are competing for access to these mines right and get to them quickly extract them quickly are properly constructing safety mechanisms to protect their workers in the steel industry around
41:44
Of frankly explosions steel explosions in the in the smelting process and the boilers that would explode and lead to
41:55
Horrible injury and death in the railroad industry. Similarly, where trains and lines like rail brakeman you know there are people who are necessary to like break the trains who could lose limbs all the times from colliding.
42:14
Trains or
42:16
Just all kinds of really ghastly
42:20
Experiences. Of course, if you're a working person and you lose a limb or you become incapacitated because of your work. There's no
42:32
There's no social safety net. So today we have a system like
42:38
SSI and SSD like disability insurance and things like that where you can receive some kind of payment or pension to make sure you're not destitute. If you lose the ability to work in this way.
42:49
There was no system like this. So if you lose a limb or whatever or a finger or a hand or are incapacitated and other ways.
43:00
And are not able to work.
43:03
The, the resources available to you after that are
43:09
Slight, shall we say.
43:13
And that's true in
43:16
The conditions of work, but also in the conditions of living. Let's see if we can
43:24
So there is no oversight regulations standardization guarantee of like living conditions, either. So housing could be also hazardous to people's health in terms of lacking proper ventilation lacking lighting having endemic like mold or test problems.
43:51
Because the the that law of competition that applied to industrial development also applied to wages. It meant that wages were continually low depressed.
44:07
And in periods of increased competition, like in depressions those wages would be pushed down even further with wage cuts or layoffs, or all of these types of things.
44:20
So, it meant that often whole families would be required to work in some capacity men typically had the
44:30
The highest standard of wage women were just paid less even when doing very similar work children paid even lower the conception around children and childhood was that children should be put to they should be made useful, they should be put to work. So there were no
44:52
There weren't public schools, for example, for children to go to or childhood wasn't thought of as like this special precious time when you when you grow and develop no children should be should be making useful.
45:07
And so it was routine to see them.
45:10
Working. We saw that in law where I think Harriet Harriet Robinson starts when she's
45:17
How old is she,
45:19
1211 I can't remember. I don't know young
45:25
But also in the mining industry.
45:28
In I don't know a whole series of industries and industrial manufacturing children are also put to work and frankly the families need the wages and so they're glad they're glad for that.
45:43
I mean, whatever. Not really. It's complicated, but necessary.
45:50
Okay.
45:52
This also lead to, oh, we're at a time. Why don't we stop, we'll start talking about political corruption next time. And think about
46:04
Some other things but i'm i'm glad. So many of you were here. I'm going to share this recording with the class. So you can look at it.
46:11
Later, and the people who miss class can see it as well.
46:15
Good to see everybody oh we. Oh, yes.
