### The New Deal and Keynesian Economics
- Rise of the new deal and Keynesian economics.
- New Deal: highly tentative, major opposition domestically to the policies - largely from the business sector.
- New Deal had enormous popular support but business community was opposed to many of these, especially the Wagner Act.
- Advent of the war - with war, there is less resistance because of wartime contracts.

#### Wagner Act
- 1938 and into the wartime period - the Wagner Act is upheld.
- Unions had dropped their radical politics.
  - Many WWI unions advocated against war.
  - WWII unions dropped militant tactics (no-strike pledges), etc. - holding onto labor visions but dropping some leftism.

#### San Francisco General Strike
- The federal government has a new role in arbitrating labor conflict; it is not pushing unions' agendas but is more sympathetic to their organizaiton and recognition.
- To Eisenhower, accepted a role in federal governments based largely on Keynesian grounds.

#### The Spirit of the New Deal
- State acted as a guaranteur of political rights for employers and employees, as a platform for which both could organize.
- Disallowed intimidation, violence, hostility; allowed exchange to happen.

### Limits of Reform
- Serious limitaitons to what got included in labor relations law changes; many exclusions.
- Wagner Act decided who got defined as a worker - employment protected by the government.
  - Debate on the passage was what types of occupation should be covered.
  - Was not universal: two crucial excluded occupations from the labor protections.
  - Domestic workers (childcare person, maid) and agricultural workers (fields, harvesting food) excluded.
- 90% of agricultural and domestic workers in 1935 were black; a way to exclude African Americans from legal, social, and democratic protections without saying so explicitly.
  - Justification given - the type of work was not advocated to apply to houework or agriculture.
  - Bargain between the Southern Democrats that stated they would support the legislation if blacks in their state would not get thee Wagner Act passed.
- These are also protections for people working in industrial manufacturing; other types of employment are not quite recognized in the same way.
  - Servicework, secretary work, retail, housework is not being recognized as work that gets similar protections.

### World War II
- December of 1941; reshapes the industrial relaitons regimes of the United States.
- Solidifies many of the reforms of the New Deal.

#### Pearl Harbor
- Based on the failures of the compromise from the first 1918 WWI and the economic crisis of the 1930s, fascist powers come to power in Italy, Germany, and other powers.
- An extremely militaristic set of foreign policies that forces European countries into another global conflict.
- December 7, 1941 - Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor.
- The United States gets involves in conflict with Germany.
  - What was significant about the attack was that it was carried out by the Japanese empire.

#### Anti-Japanese Propaganda
- A series of racist hysteria that emerged around the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor feeding on long-standing West Coast anti-Asian sentiment.
- Most prints - some by oil companies, government agencies - are about labor productivity in wartime industries.
  - By having accidents, you encourage the enemy.
- Racial language and tropes have been developed in U.S. racial discourse; undergoing a continuation and a shift in many ways.
- One of the first executive orders coming out of the Roosevelt presidency following the bombing was internment.

#### Japanese Internment
- Some immigrantsd from Japan were interned, but also many natural-born citizens.
- A series of Supreme Court hearings that ruled these Constitutional.
  - Became the policy of the federal government for which they apologized and paid reparations.
- First people to be rounded up in government trucks and tagged.
  - Justification: wartime necessity; Japanese people constituted a military threat.
  - However, it is children being tagged and transported.
- Internment was happening on the west Coast, but in Hawaii there was no internment despite the high Japanese population.

### The Second World War and the Arsenal of Democracy
- U.S. developed a public-private synthesis over the course of the war to develop ammunitions.
- Develop a board to oversee orders and facilitate government orders.
- Automobile, airplane, and aerospace companies come out of this moment.
  - Have cost+ contracts with the government (guaranteed profit).
  - Government guarantees working conditions for maximum hours and wages.
- Birth of the tech industry and relationship between private companies and the government.
  - Government funding for military usages - computer systems, etc.
  - Relationship between government funding and the private sector.
- Resulting huge demand for labor; millions of men and women are serving and working.

#### Primary Labor Force
- Collapse of demand in the New Deal is undone as the federal government needs everything.
- Scarcity of labor, people are going to war.
- Primary labor market - unionized, high paying government contract jobs - had been mostly the purview of white men, but now are opened up to other segments of the population.
- Federal government actively recruit women (Rosie the Riveter mythology, etc.), but did not do the same for African Americans into primary labor market jobs.
  - Black workers continued to be excluded from these jobs.
  - Many black organizations began to organize and agitate for these protections.

#### Double Victory Campaign
- Many black soldiers served, but were serving in segregated units.
- A shipyard in Alabama - practicing Jim Crow - can continue to discriminate, for example, as a private entity.
- Black political organizations, church groups, etc. developed a Double V campaign.
- Too claims in the government about fighting fascism - if fighting against fascism in Europe and for democratic societies there, what about democracy at home?
- How different are racial policies in the United States to those of Nazi Germany?
- Recognize this distinction - fighting an antifascist war, not seeing this at home.

#### A. Phillip Randolph
- Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Randolph decided to organize around this question.
- Black workers need to believe in this democracy at home.
- Leverage war rhetoric to get gains for black workers.
- With the New Deal, are being excluded economically as well; further excluded by war contracts.
- 1943, called for a march on Washington for jobs and freedom during the war.
  - Two pieces are being linked in this moment; threatens this wartime march.
- Mobilize a political demonstration against the government on wartime.
  - Threat worked and the FDR administration did not want to see marches happening during wartime.
  - FDR caved and agreed; signed executive order 8802 - desegregated war industries for the first time.
- Black workers suddenly had access to these jobs being read about.

#### War's End
- 1945 - Soviet Union defeats Germany with aid from an Allied Invasion.
- United States has gone on to defeat Japan and uses two atomic weapons.

### The 1945-1946 Strike Wave
- A massive strike wave - largest in United States history - in 1946.
- Largely about keeping protections and not regressing to a prewar or pre-New Deal type of labor regime and relationship.
- The entire mindset was different - Keynesianism had proved important to restructuring the economy, ideologically there are reasons for doing so.
- Mass worker organizations in the CIO and labor movement - representing about 1/3 of Americans - in most of the key industries.
  - Construction, rail, automobile, steel, etc. are all unionized.
- Demonstrating these in postwar strikes.
- System being experimented with holds and continues into the postwar period.
- Racial integgration of unions - black workers are working in automobile jobs en masse for the first time.
  - Automobile workers would stage hate strikes - would strike their job if it was being integrated.
  - Hate strikes led to a 1943 Detroit riot, in which a dozen black people are killed.
  - Lots of tension around this.
  - Questions around radical unions - UE was a Communist influenced union (refused to purge Communists)

### Freedom From Want
- Emphasis on the economy has to be on consumer spending.
- Capitalist democracies are not to survive if they continue laissez faire system of the Gilded Age, or even Progressivism as a tempered version.
- Claims that the Roosevelt administration was making was an attempt to push in that direction.
- This economic vision could be made possible with an economic bill of rights.

#### Economic Bill of Rights
- Roosevelt administration was arguing for a "second bill of rights" to be added to a bill of rights.
- Political rights, it was argued, must be supplemented by economic rights.
- Need to be universal.
- Ran a campaign for this second bill of rights.
- Was passed as the "GE Bill of Rights" - "GE": general enlistment.
- Serve in the military, the government will pay for your college, a subsidized or no interest home loan, healthcare, preferential hiring on jobs.

#### The Fifth Freedom
- Only certain segments of the population are getting sets of protections; a patchwork.
- Political backlash: 19, 20 years post-Great Depression, the ideas that the business community had supported pre-Depression are seeking ways to reassert themselves.
- A massive propaganda effort in dialogue with the Roosevelt's claim of the four freedoms.
  - Business community says the fifth freedom is the free enterprise system.
  - Consider this part of the penanoly of freedoms we have.
- Viability of other New Deal programs, etc. woudl falter.
- Now, when we think of economic freedoms, we think about free market policies and not Roosevelt's economic policies.
  - Shows the success on the ideological front of these ideas.

#### Friedrich von Hayek, The Road to Serfdom
- von Hayek was an antifascist, trying to think about and understanding how the Nazi party came to be and how Nazi totalitarianism emerged.
- Answer: effort to restrain economic freedoms, to influence market failures, and to create a more regulated and aggressive role for the government meant a slow agglomeration of state power.
  - Effort to regulate private enterprise is an expansion of state power and opening the road to serfdom.
- Is a foundational bedrock for free market intellectuals in the postwar period.
- Expansion of welfare state, etc. - becoming more fascist.

### Labor, Taft-Hartley, and Politics
- Many of the mechanisms that enabled labor parties were taken back.
- If you're part of a union and you're striking for someone else, this is no longer allowed.
- You could not be a communist and part of a union.
  - Political sympathies or had been a party member, outlawed union participation.
- Made it more difficult for unions to be effective.

<br>

<br>


### A New Industrial Relations System
- 1950s and beyond - guaranteeing a consumer society without the radicalism, militant tactics, disruption, etc. to regulate economic growth, overcome boom-bust cycles, and have workers as part of this economic boom.
- There are very severe limitations and restrictions.

#### Two Labor Markets
- White workers have particular sets of benefits in a two-tiered labor market.
