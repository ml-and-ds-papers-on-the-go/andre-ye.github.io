### The New Deal and Keynesian Economics
- Rise of the new deal and Keynesian economics.
- New Deal: highly tentative, major opposition domestically to the policies - largely from the business sector.
- New Deal had enormous popular support but business community was opposed to many of these, especially the Wagner Act.
- Advent of the war - with war, there is less resistance because of wartime contracts.

#### Wagner Act
- 1938 and into the wartime period - the Wagner Act is upheld.
- Unions had dropped their radical politics.
  - Many WWI unions advocated against war.
  - WWII unions dropped militant tactics (no-strike pledges), etc. - holding onto labor visions but dropping some leftism.

#### San Francisco General Strike
- The federal government has a new role in arbitrating labor conflict; it is not pushing unions' agendas but is more sympathetic to their organizaiton and recognition.
- To Eisenhower, accepted a role in federal governments based largely on Keynesian grounds.

#### The Spirit of the New Deal
- State acted as a guaranteur of political rights for employers and employees, as a platform for which both could organize.
- Disallowed intimidation, violence, hostility; allowed exchange to happen.

### Limits of Reform
- Serious limitaitons to what got included in labor relations law changes; many exclusions.
- Wagner Act decided who got defined as a worker - employment protected by the government.
  - Debate on the passage was what types of occupation should be covered.
  - Was not universal: two crucial excluded occupations from the labor protections.
  - Domestic workers (childcare person, maid) and agricultural workers (fields, harvesting food) excluded.
- 90% of agricultural and domestic workers in 1935 were black; a way to exclude African Americans from legal, social, and democratic protections without saying so explicitly.
  - Justification given - the type of work was not advocated to apply to houework or agriculture.
  - Bargain between the Southern Democrats that stated they would support the legislation if blacks in their state would not get thee Wagner Act passed.
- These are also protections for people working in industrial manufacturing; other types of employment are not quite recognized in the same way.
  - Servicework, secretary work, retail, housework is not being recognized as work that gets similar protections.

### World War II
- December of 1941; reshapes the industrial relaitons regimes of the United States.
- Solidifies many of the reforms of the New Deal.

#### Pearl Harbor
- Based on the failures of the compromise from the first 1918 WWI and the economic crisis of the 1930s, fascist powers come to power in Italy, Germany, and other powers.
- An extremely militaristic set of foreign policies that forces European countries into another global conflict.
- December 7, 1941 - Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor.
- The United States gets involves in conflict with Germany.
  - What was significant about the attack was that it was carried out by the Japanese empire.

#### Anti-Japanese Propaganda
- A series of racist hysteria that emerged around the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor feeding on long-standing West Coast anti-Asian sentiment.
- Most prints - some by oil companies, government agencies - are about labor productivity in wartime industries.
  - By having accidents, you encourage the enemy.
- Racial language and tropes have been developed in U.S. racial discourse; undergoing a continuation and a shift in many ways.
