### Introduction
- Some may be surprised at the extent of class conflict.
- Jacob Riis, Bandit's Roost, 1888, from *How the Other Half Lives*.
  - The class divide; what is America supposed to be?
  - What are the hierarchies present in the image? (us/them)
  - Riis draws us not only towards the construction of class differences but social problems around *crime*.
  - Hostility; political tensions present.
  - Gets at themes emerging in the Gilded Age - **the emergence of social class as a marker of American society**; sets of interests and sides in American society.
- **Central questions**: Why did the Gilded Age experience so much class conflict and violence? What was the role of the state and other social institutions?
  - *gilded age* - the appearance of success and prosperity with an underlying set of tensions. Contrast with the *golden age*.
  - Class Conflict
    - The second industrial revoltuion brought increased competition and conflict for industry and labor.
  - Violence and the state
    - Social conflict provoked violence, with the state taking a partisan role.
      - Haymarket, the Great Railroad Strike, Pullman, etc.
  - The Social Question:
    - How does one address the violence between labor and capital? Can social institutions survive modernity? Are democracy and industrial capitalism compatible?

### Lucy and Albert Parsons
- Very convenient transition from Reconstruction into the Guilded Age.
- Lucy Parsons is likely born enslaved and wins freedom across the course of the Civil War. Becomes an activist for black equality in Reconstruction.
- Albert Parsons was a Confederate soldier before having a change of heart, becoming a Republican.
- While there waas the possibility of greater forms of black equality, by the 1870s this begins to close; legislatures retake control of Southern state power and legislate against black voting  and interracial relationships.
- Travelled to Industrial Chicago in mid 1870s.

### Industrial Chicago
- An enormous fire in the city (1870) that miped out the majority of the city.
- Was a trading center for many cities in the region; near the Great Lakes.
- As it rebuilds, it develops along this urban explosion of buildings.
  - The population of the city doubles from 500,000 to 1m people (second largest city in the US at that time).
  - A city so far West was remarkable.
  - 3/4 residents are immigrants.
- Industrializing is set on a few key industries;
  - Meat packing; all the ranch land of the interior can ship livestock to Chicago.
  - Timber; harvest timber fields of the Michigan penninsula or upper-west (e.g. Minnesota).
  - These draw streams of immigrants to fill labor demands.

#### Back of the Yards and Stateless Expansion
- This led to very problematic living conditions.
- Industrial development (e.g. harvesting of timber) is not being regulated (i.e. thought of as a limited resource).
- Development of factories was propelled in the interest of productivity instead of protecting workers.
- Living conditions of people coming into the cities: one could construct housing very quickly, but no sewers, water, garbage infastructure, sanitation, etc.
- The "Back of the Yards" ; back of the *train yards*.
  - Chicago was the hub in a network of resource extraction from all across the Great Plains.
  - Farmers growing wheat nad corn in Illinois and Ohio and ranchers herding cattle from Texas to Montana can ship their products to Chicago.
  - Is the intersection of a transcontinental railroad.
  - Chicago has access to a huge expanse from which its industrial factories can process themselves.
- Right next to the railroad, housing for factory workers were created.
  - These developed without any social planning.
  - Conditions people found themselves in: extremely poor.
  - Multiple depressions; extreme poverty was experienced. Children were often employed to scavenge for food, or some other method to squeeze out an existence.

#### 1873 Great Depression
- Chicago impacted by the 1873 Great Depression; failures in the banking system (failure to issue bonds for a railroad construction project) led to the collapse of the credit card system.
  - Businesses couldn't spend money on wages, provide paychecks, etc.
  - The economy ground to a halt and people were thrown out of work even amidst the expansion of places like industrial Chicago.
  - The pressures of poverty; firms have pressures to maintain profitability but laying people off or cutting wages. Poverty was this exacerbated.

### Ethnic Workers and Radical Demands
- The Parsons come to this city in the 1780s and 1790s; begins a process of radicalization for them.
- Albert Parsons runs for the City Council as a socialist, finds that the system of business-driven politics makes it such that even if everyone on the city council was elected as a socialist, there was no meaningful space for reform.
  - Government transformed from a solution to a *problem*.
  - Transitioned from thinking themselves as anticaptialist socialists, began thinking of themselves as anticapitalist anarchists.
- Radicalization was also being driven by ethnic workers from Europe that had a more articulated conception of socialist politics that was brought with them.
  - Industrializing centers of Europe (Rhine River Valley, Bavaria, Paris, Manchester) experiencing rapid industrialism; come to the United States and see parallels. Socialist politics translate fairly easily, and a robust political and workers' movement around socialist ideas.
- August Spies - ran the "Arbeiter-Zeitung", the "Workers' Times" that was increasingly socialist and anarchist. Discussed problems of poverty.

#### Socialism and Anarchism
- Socialism is an economic philosophy, and counterposes itself against liberalism (belief in private property). States that property should be held *collectively*, and the property of society should be held through social trust. Some sort of governmental agency is needed to decide that - democratic or authoritian.
- Anarchists were socialists that thought the socialization of property should not be done by the government. Any form of government organization of this socialization would be as tyrannical as liberalism.

### May Day and the Movement for the Eight Hour Day
- Development of an eight-hour movement in the city of Chicago.
  - Then-currently, no regulations for hour production is done inside production; owners could set production based on their markets and schedules without considering the needs of workers.
    - In the steel industry, not uncommon to have 12 hour flips that would flip every week (day and night shifts).
    - Lowell labor unions fought for a *ten-hour* workday.
- Initially attempted to push eight-hour day through firms (i.e. strikes until an eight-hour day).
  - Firms would hire strike-breakers; other newcomers desperate to take work were hired.
  - If workers attempted to prevent others from taking the job, employers would hire private security (like the Pinkertons) or the police department to break up the strikes.
  - Frequently, striking workers were killed to clear out the area and to allow new people to come in.
  - Winning at the firm level was difficult.
- Fought to pass a law that forced all firms to limit the day to ten hours; this was mainly the Parsons's political work.
  - Despite their anarchist views, most of their political work was around relatively basic work around this law.
  - 1884: labor unions expect by 1886 for this law to be passed.
  - If the law is not passed by May 1st, a citywide strike will occur.
  - The city did not pass anything.

#### McCormick International Harvester Lockout and Strike
- 50k strikers on May 1st, 1886; it is fairly successful and a day of protest.
- On May 2nd, everyone goes back to work; yet some firms (e.g. McCormick Harvester that made tractors) refused to let the workers back in.
- A trope in American politics around irrational, radical, hysterical women. (i.e. "fire-breathing anarchists")
- Workers at McCormick International Harvester are locked out and the police are called in; the police kill two strikers.
- Radicals nevertheless are feeling particularly stong; attempted for another strike in a few days to demonstrate against *the killing* of the workers.
  - Perhaps contributing to pressure for the city or McCormick to settle the strike.
- Prosecuters alleged that radicals were calling not only for a strike but a *revenge*.

### Rally at Haymarket
- Not many people showed up; perhaps a few hundred.
- Occurred in May, so conditions were not quite pleasant - rainy, muddy, cold.
- The rally disappates; at one point, everyone is there (August Spies, Albert and Lucy Parsons).
- Everyone begins going home.
- After the last speaker gets off the stage, the police - who have been holding off - decide to march into the plaza to clear it.
- As soon as they begin to come in, an unknown somebody throws a bomb at the police lines and kills several police officers.
  - The police officers shoot into the crowd and cause a horrible scene.
- This incident - from Mayday Strikes to the bombing - is the *Haymarket Affair*.

#### Police Repression of the Anarchists
- This is the basis for which anarchist positions are repressed.
- They are prevented from editorializing, producing literature.
- Eight radicals are arrested and put on trial not for the act of throwing the bomb; accused of creating the *climate* and publishing ideas that led to someone who would want to throw the bomb.
  - Are placed on trial against a notoriously hostile judge; the trial is widely regarded as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in the American judicial system.
- There was no attempt by police to find the bombthrower; instead looked to the political leaders of the worker's movement.
  - All were convicted, and several were executed (2 pardoned later, 1 commits suicide). Albert Parsons later turned himself in and believed he would have a fair trial, was later executed.
    - As Albert Parsons is on trial, Lucy Parsons puts forward her "I am an Anarchist" speech.
  - The trial becomes an international affair on its own; the Haymarket martyrs (the Anarchists of Chicago) were "celebrities" of sorts.
- Newspapers reporting on the ins and outs of their personal lives; a media spectacle.

#### Legacy of Haymarket
- Becomes a moment of reckoning in American society.
- Basic reforms we take as being self-evident today were seemingly impossible to achieve in the class-driven society at the end of the 19th century.
- Affair points to the degree to which the state would use violence in thwarting the efforts of industrial workers. 
  - Not only in the police force, but also in the entire legal infastructure.
- What is the role of the state? A major purveyor of the violence is government, in the form of the police and the court system.
 - What would the role of government be in this conflict? How would it navigate this new terrain?
- The Parsons did not see the state as a solution; but instead as perpetually contributing to the problem.
- Employers could use the police, the government, the army, and other institutions to enforce.
 - Many socialists argued for electing workers, etc.; argued that this would simply lead to other forms of inequality.
 - A hotbed of radicalism.

### The Second Industrial Revolution

#### Prelude
- Chicago Police Force and judiciary & legal system was attempting to put an end to the ability of radicals to organize.
 - This led to the flowering of radicalism, not only in the United States but internationally.
 - Many regions set May 1st as a worker's day.
- A global radicalization, and radicalization in the United States.
- Emma Goldman, young immigrant to the United States; an extremely famous radical anarchist.
 - Radicalized by the Haymarket trial as a 15 to 16 year old, setting her path towards the politics of the Haymarket Martyrs.
- **Haymarket is just the tip of the iceberg**; there were at least a dozen other incidents in the late 19th century.
- What is the context behind it that is producing this? *The second industrial revolution.*

#### Beginnings of the Second Industrial Revolution
- The first industrial was discussed with Lowell.
 - Power sources are an important aspect; Lowell power sources from water, second industrial revolution used electricity.
- A significant change, utilizing fossil fuels.
- Interchangable parts of rifles - example of mechanized production.
- Nevertheless, the railroad industry is the most important part of this.

#### The Steam Engine and Railroads
- Initially used in mining to pump water, but it became clear that this engine could be applied to all  kinds of production to drive machinery.
 - For example, transportation on river boats or for railroads.
- Railroads are the most sophisticated and politically dominant industry in the 1870s, 80s, and 90s.
 - There are stock market frenzies, booms, and busts built on the railroad industry; pouring capital to fund competing industries.
- You had to spend money from the outset to think about getting returns from the freight that would be shipped; bankruptcies were rife in the railroad industry.
- Technological advancement gave rise to new forms of transit, exchange, geographic scope, continental expanse, etc.

#### The Role of the State
- Much of the success of railroads came from support from the state; given massive swathes of land.
 - If the track were built, it would make the land more accessible and desirable to, say, farmers.
 - The railroads could thus sell their lands as part of their profit model to help them survive, as well as other incentives.
- Regions would compete to have the railroad run through them; i.e. tax incentives for railroad companies.
- A form of speculation - get gifted land, then parcel it and set it out.
- State is providing grants and subsidies for these corporations.

### Industrial Fortunes
- Leads to the largest creation of wealth and wealth inequality ever.
 - Leading figures are John Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie; were not railroad barons but ancillary industries (oil and steel, respectively).
- Rockefeller got his start in the Civil War with government contracts; involved in the oil extraction industry.
 - Finds that railroad companies are ripping him off; they've monopolized the track and are charging him more money. Solution: buy the railroad companies. *and so on w/ other companies.* Continued using a vertical itnegration model.
 - At one point, controlled 90% of the oil market in the entirety of the country.
 - Near complete monopolistic control of a whole vertical.
- Carnegie attempted a *horizontal* integration - just steel manufacturing.
 - Created the largest U.S. American manufacturing company - U.S. Steel, the first company valued at a billion dollars.
- Can pre-industrial capitalism forms of government survive monpolistic market control and other industrial capitalism?

<br>

### Conditions of Labor
- For working people, the state had a more *antagonistic* approach; government was providing protections for corporate growth and expansion (contracts), but no similar protections for working people.
 - **Little protections for working or living conditions**.
 - Led to extreme poverty with few protections.
 - Ruinous competition; firms that would compete with each other and collapse the entire industry. Parallels with competition in *labor markets*.
  - The shared legal principle is that the government should not interfere with the process.
- The state was taking action to spur and advance industrial properties, not taking action to mitigate wealth inequality or thinking about redistributive efforts, **workers had no similar protections.**
- No protection in terms of working conditions.
 - 35,000 people were being killed in industrial accidents in workplaces every year; growth of factories geared towards profit maximization are not considering the human conditions of poeple doing the work.
  - Every industry faces horrifying industrial accidents; collapsed mines, steel explosions, brakemen, etc.
  - Furthermore, if you are incapacitated, there are few resources available.
- No protection in terms of consumers and living standards.
 - No oversight regulation standardization guarantees of living conditions; lack of proper ventilation, for example.
 - The law of competition that applies to industrial development also applies to wages, which were continually low.
 - During periods of increased competition, wages would be pushed down even further.
- Often whole families would need to work; men had the highest standard of wage, women had lower pay even if doing similar work, and children had even lower pay.
 - The standard consensus was to make children useful, and it would be thus routine to see them working.
 - Children are put to work, and the families need the wages.

### Political Corruption

#### The Bosses of the Senate
- This disequalibrium raised questions about the viability of democratic practice.
- **What does it mean to say you have access to democratic rights when there are limitations on your relationship with the government?**
 - It helps if you can sponsor a politician.
 - Helping to provide services that favor the popularity of politicians.
- Enormous and unprecedented monopolists and corporations could sponsor congresspeople and lobby politically.
 - The "Senator from Standard Oil"
- Continues into outright corruption; there are a whole series of scandals at the local, state, and federal level.
- Local level.
 - *New York City machine Tweed ring*.
 - The process of providing payments, positions, and patronage to vote for particular politicians.
- State level.
 - Pennsylvania; railroads were "the third state house" because of their influence on state politics.
- Federal level.
 - Railroad companies served on government boards.
 - A commission would be formed to oversee infrastructure; companies would get executives on the board to deal with themselves.
- A **trust** - an attempt to influence market competition by individual firms comign to an agreement on what the prices should be.
 - The companies are not driving themselves out, agreeing on the minimum price to protect market viability.

#### The Courts and Liberty of Contract
- A change in the judicial system; how do courts decide on market agglomeration and similar subjects?
- Railroads - if there is only one railroad line to a particular region, it has a monopoly on that market and can charge whatever they want.
 - Farmers pissed about this lobbied the state of Illinois to draft a law that regulated the price of railroad commerce.
 - Law: railroads cannot charge below a certain amount, or *above* a certain amount.
 - Railroads took it to the Supreme Court; the Supreme Court initially *agreed*. It kept markets viable and facilitated free exchange.
 - By 1886, after 10 years, the Supreme Court ruled exactly the opposite; market limitations is a violation of a legal principle of **liberty of contract**.
- **Liberty of contract** - as part of the Constitutional guarantee around property rights, people, firms, companies should not be disrupted by third parties of any type from making free contracts with anyone they should choose.
 - The timber and railroad company can make an exchange for how much they want to make.
 - Applies to employment as well.
- Laissez-faire capitalism; a contradiction between the government playing an active role and also advocating for the liberty of contract.
- **The Grange movement** - farmers' movement against railroad company control. Eventually lose in the Supreme Court because of Liberty of Contract.

### New Ideologies: Social Darwinism
- New ideologies are also emerging; the guiding orthodoxies of social relationships change.
- Social Darwinism: social thinkers in the 19th century (Herbert Spencer, William Sumner) take the conception of Darwinian evolution and apply it to societies.
 - What if people develop traits that make them well-developed or not to modern civilization?
 - Is this is an unchanging law of biology and society, and therefore thinking about competition for survival means that mitigating this is not helpful?
 - Is it such that those that are unfit should die? Does this further human evolution?
- Applications: are immigrants well-adapted to society?
 - Racial and class dynamics.
- Spencer and Sumner are not just in the elite press, but making it into society more broadly.

> Least of all does the world owe a living to the deadbeats, vagrants, dunkards, thieves, guttersnipes, Communists, and vicious loafers who came to the front and demanded it in recent riots. The world owes these classes rather extermination than a livelihood. -Chicago Tribune, 1877.

> The worst specimens fo feminine depravity; scatter in all the red-headed, cross-eyed, and frowsy servant girls in the three divisions of the city. -Chicago Tribune, 1879. (on the Chicago march for the Paris Commune)

<br>

### Strikes and Violent Conflict
- This type of thinking, this vision of the state, etc. meant that for the late 1800s, these conflicts continued.
- Many people begin the era with the 1877 Railroad Strike, but continued.
- Wabash Strike; Southwest. The federal government is called in to put down strikers and rioters; shooting protesters.
 - Federal government develops a national armory system. Weapons are held in major cities to deal with social unrest.
- Pullman Strike. Pullman railcard owned the housing and the factories that workers lived in; cut wages during the depression and raised rent on the housing they charged.
 - Federal government was brought in to take jobs and put down rioting.
- Homestead strike in 1892
- The Coal Wars of the American West; coal workers were involved in shooting matches with employers.
- 1911 Ludlowe massacre, where workers and their families were burnt out and killed by a firm owned by Rockefeller.
- **How do we make sense of the violent conflict?**
