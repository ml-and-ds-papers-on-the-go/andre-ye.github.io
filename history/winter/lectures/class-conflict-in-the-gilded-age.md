## Introduction
- Some may be surprised at the extent of class conflict.
- Jacob Riis, Bandit's Roost, 1888, from *How the Other Half Lives*.
  - The class divide; what is America supposed to be?
  - What are the hierarchies present in the image? (us/them)
  - Riis draws us not only towards the construction of class differences but social problems around *crime*.
  - Hostility; political tensions present.
- **Central questions**: Why did the Gilded Age experience so much class conflict and violence? What was the role of the state and other social institutions
  - *gilded age* - the appearance of success and prosperity with an underlying set of tensions. Contrast with the *golden age*.
  - Class Conflict
    - The second industrial revoltuion brought increased competition and conflict for industry and labor.
