### Introduction
- Some may be surprised at the extent of class conflict.
- Jacob Riis, Bandit's Roost, 1888, from *How the Other Half Lives*.
  - The class divide; what is America supposed to be?
  - What are the hierarchies present in the image? (us/them)
  - Riis draws us not only towards the construction of class differences but social problems around *crime*.
  - Hostility; political tensions present.
  - Gets at themes emerging in the Gilded Age - **the emergence of social class as a marker of American society**; sets of interests and sides in American society.
- **Central questions**: Why did the Gilded Age experience so much class conflict and violence? What was the role of the state and other social institutions?
  - *gilded age* - the appearance of success and prosperity with an underlying set of tensions. Contrast with the *golden age*.
  - Class Conflict
    - The second industrial revoltuion brought increased competition and conflict for industry and labor.
  - Violence and the state
    - Social conflict provoked violence, with the state taking a partisan role.
      - Haymarket, the Great Railroad Strike, Pullman, etc.
  - The Social Question:
    - How does one address the violence between labor and capital? Can social institutions survive modernity? Are democracy and industrial capitalism compatible?

### Lucy and Albert Parsons
- Very convenient transition from Reconstruction into the Guilded Age.
- Lucy Parsons is likely born enslaved and wins freedom across the course of the Civil War. Becomes an activist for black equality in Reconstruction.
- Albert Parsons was a Confederate soldier before having a change of heart, becoming a Republican.
- While there waas the possibility of greater forms of black equality, by the 1870s this begins to close; legislatures retake control of Southern state power and legislate against black voting  and interracial relationships.
- Travelled to Industrial Chicago in mid 1870s.

### Industrial Chicago
- An enormous fire in the city (1870) that miped out the majority of the city.
- Was a trading center for many cities in the region; near the Great Lakes.
- As it rebuilds, it develops along this urban explosion of buildings.
  - The population of the city doubles from 500,000 to 1m people (second largest city in the US at that time).
  - A city so far West was remarkable.
  - 3/4 residents are immigrants.
- Industrializing is set on a few key industries;
  - Meat packing; all the ranch land of the interior can ship livestock to Chicago.
  - Timber; harvest timber fields of the Michigan penninsula or upper-west (e.g. Minnesota).
  - These draw streams of immigrants to fill labor demands.

#### Back of the Yards and Stateless Expansion
- This led to very problematic living conditions.
- Industrial development (e.g. harvesting of timber) is not being regulated (i.e. thought of as a limited resource).
- Development of factories was propelled in the interest of productivity instead of protecting workers.
- Living conditions of people coming into the cities: one could construct housing very quickly, but no sewers, water, garbage infastructure, sanitation, etc.
- The "Back of the Yards" ; back of the *train yards*.
  - Chicago was the hub in a network of resource extraction from all across the Great Plains.
  - Farmers growing wheat nad corn in Illinois and Ohio and ranchers herding cattle from Texas to Montana can ship their products to Chicago.
  - Is the intersection of a transcontinental railroad.
  - Chicago has access to a huge expanse from which its industrial factories can process themselves.
- Right next to the railroad, housing for factory workers were created.
  - These developed without any social planning.
  - Conditions people found themselves in: extremely poor.
  - Multiple depressions; extreme poverty was experienced. Children were often employed to scavenge for food, or some other method to squeeze out an existence.

#### 1873 Great Depression
- Chicago impacted by the 1873 Great Depression; failures in the banking system (failure to issue bonds for a railroad construction project) led to the collapse of the credit card system.
  - Businesses couldn't spend money on wages, provide paychecks, etc.
  - The economy ground to a halt and people were thrown out of work even amidst the expansion of places like industrial Chicago.
  - The pressures of poverty; firms have pressures to maintain profitability but laying people off or cutting wages. Poverty was this exacerbated.

### Ethnic Workers and Radical Demands
- The Parsons come to this city in the 1780s and 1790s; begins a process of radicalization for them.
- Albert Parsons runs for the City Council as a socialist, finds that the system of business-driven politics makes it such that even if everyone on the city council was elected as a socialist, there was no meaningful space for reform.
  - Government transformed from a solution to a *problem*.
  - Transitioned from thinking themselves as anticaptialist socialists, began thinking of themselves as anticapitalist anarchists.
- Radicalization was also being driven by ethnic workers from Europe that had a more articulated conception of socialist politics that was brought with them.
  - Industrializing centers of Europe (Rhine River Valley, Bavaria, Paris, Manchester) experiencing rapid industrialism; come to the United States and see parallels. Socialist politics translate fairly easily, and a robust political and workers' movement around socialist ideas.
- August Spies - ran the "Arbeiter-Zeitung", the "Workers' Times" that was increasingly socialist and anarchist. Discussed problems of poverty.

#### Socialism and Anarchism
- Socialism is an economic philosophy, and counterposes itself against liberalism (belief in private property). States that property should be held *collectively*, and the property of society should be held through social trust. Some sort of governmental agency is needed to decide that - democratic or authoritian.
- Anarchists were socialists that thought the socialization of property should not be done by the government. Any form of government organization of this socialization would be as tyrannical as liberalism.

### May Day and the Movement for the Eight Hour Day
- Development of an eight-hour movement in the city of Chicago.
  - Then-currently, no regulations for hour production is done inside production; owners could set production based on their markets and schedules without considering the needs of workers.
    - In the steel industry, not uncommon to have 12 hour flips that would flip every week (day and night shifts).
    - Lowell labor unions fought for a *ten-hour* workday.
- Initially attempted to push eight-hour day through firms (i.e. strikes until an eight-hour day).
  - Firms would hire strike-breakers; other newcomers desperate to take work were hired.
  - If workers attempted to prevent others from taking the job, employers would hire private security (like the Pinkertons) or the police department to break up the strikes.
  - Frequently, striking workers were killed to clear out the area and to allow new people to come in.
  - Winning at the firm level was difficult.
- Fought to pass a law that forced all firms to limit the day to ten hours; this was mainly the Parsons's political work.
  - Despite their anarchist views, most of their political work was around relatively basic work around this law.
  - 1884: labor unions expect by 1886 for this law to be passed.
  - If the law is not passed by May 1st, a citywide strike will occur.
  - The city did not pass anything.

#### McCormick International Harvester Lockout and Strike
- 50k strikers on May 1st, 1886; it is fairly successful and a day of protest.
- On May 2nd, everyone goes back to work; yet some firms (e.g. McCormick Harvester that made tractors) refused to let the workers back in.
- A trope in American politics around irrational, radical, hysterical women. (i.e. "fire-breathing anarchists")
- Workers at McCormick International Harvester are locked out and the police are called in; the police kill two strikers.
- Radicals nevertheless are feeling particularly stong; attempted for another strike in a few days to demonstrate against *the killing* of the workers.
  - Perhaps contributing to pressure for the city or McCormick to settle the strike.
- Prosecuters alleged that radicals were calling not only for a strike but a *revenge*.

### Rally at Haymarket
- Not many people showed up; perhaps a few hundred.
- Occurred in May, so conditions were not quite pleasant - rainy, muddy, cold.
- The rally disappates; at one point, everyone is there (August Spies, Albert and Lucy Parsons).
- Everyone begins going home.
- After the last speaker gets off the stage, the police - who have been holding off - decide to march into the plaza to clear it.
- As soon as they begin to come in, an unknown somebody throws a bomb at the police lines and kills several police officers.
  - The police officers shoot into the crowd and cause a horrible scene.
- This incident - from Mayday Strikes to the bombing - is the *Haymarket Affair*.

#### Police Repression of the Anarchists
- This is the basis for which anarchist positions are repressed.
- They are prevented from editorializing, producing literature.
- Eight radicals are arrested and put on trial not for the act of throwing the bomb; accused of creating the *climate* and publishing ideas that led to someone who would want to throw the bomb.
  - Are placed on trial against a notoriously hostile judge; the trial is widely regarded as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in the American judicial system.
- There was no attempt by police to find the bombthrower; instead looked to the political leaders of the worker's movement.
  - All were convicted, and several were executed (2 pardoned later, 1 commits suicide). Albert Parsons later turned himself in and believed he would have a fair trial, was later executed.
    - As Albert Parsons is on trial, Lucy Parsons puts forward her "I am an Anarchist" speech.
  - The trial becomes an international affair on its own; the Haymarket martyrs (the Anarchists of Chicago) were "celebrities" of sorts.
- Newspapers reporting on the ins and outs of their personal lives; a media spectacle.

#### Legacy of Haymarket
- Becomes a moment of reckoning in American society.
- Basic reforms we take as being self-evident today were seemingly impossible to achieve in the class-driven society at the end of the 19th century.
- Affair points to the degree to which the state would use violence in thwarting the efforts of industrial workers. 
  - Not only in the police force, but also in the entire legal infastructure.
- What is the role of the state? A major purveyor of the violence is government, in the form of the police and the court system.
 - What would the role of government be in this conflict? How would it navigate this new terrain?
- The Parsons did not see the state as a solution; but instead as perpetually contributing to the problem.
- Employers could use the police, the government, the army, and other institutions to enforce.
 - Many socialists argued for electing workers, etc.; argued that this would simply lead to other forms of inequality.
 - A hotbed of radicalism.

### The Second Industrial Revolution

#### Prelude
- Chicago Police Force and judiciary & legal system was attempting to put an end to the ability of radicals to organize.
 - This led to the flowering of radicalism, not only in the United States but internationally.
 - Many regions set May 1st as a worker's day.
- A global radicalization, and radicalization in the United States.
- Emma Goldman, young immigrant to the United States; an extremely famous radical anarchist.
 - Radicalized by the Haymarket trial as a 15 to 16 year old, setting her path towards the politics of the Haymarket Martyrs.
- **Haymarket is just the tip of the iceberg**; there were at least a dozen other incidents in the late 19th century.
- What is the context behind it that is producing this? *The second industrial revolution.*

#### Beginnings of the Second Industrial Revolution
- The first industrial was discussed with Lowell.
- Power sources are an important; Lowell power sources from water, second industrial revolution used electricity.
- A significant change, utilizing fossil fuels.
- Interchangable parts of rifles - example of mechanized production.
- Nevertheless, the railroad industry is the most important part of this.

#### The Steam Engine and Railroads
- Initially used in mining to pump water, but it became clear that this engine could be applied to all  kinds of production to drive machinery.
 - For example, transportation on river boats or for railroads.
- Railroads are the most sophisticated and politically dominant industry in the 1870s, 80s, and 90s.
 - There are stock market frenzies, booms, and busts built on the railroad industry; pouring capital to fund competing industries.
- You had to spend money from the outset to think about getting returns from the freight that would be shipped; bankruptcies were rife in the railroad industry.

#### The Role of the State
- Much of the success of railroads came from support from the state; given massive swathes of land.
 - If the track were built, it would make the land more accessible and desirable to, say, farmers.
 - The railroads could thus sell their lands as part of their profit model to help them survive, as well as other incentives.
- Regions would compete to have the railroad run through them; i.e. tax incentives for railroad companies.
- A form of speculation - get gifted land, then parcel it and set it out.
- State is providing grants and subsidies for these corporations.

### Industrial Fortunes
- Leads to the largest creation of wealth and wealth inequality ever.
 - Leading figures are John Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie; were not railroad barons but ancillary industries (oil and steel, respectively).
- Rockefeller got his start in the Civil War with government contracts; involved in the oil extraction industry.
 - Finds that railroad companies are ripping him off; they've monopolized the track and are charging him more money. Solution: buy the railroad companies. *and so on w/ other companies.* Continued using a vertical itnegration model.
 - At one point, controlled 90% of the oil market in the entirety of the country.
 - Near complete monopolistic control of a whole vertical.
- Carnegie attempted a *horizontal* integration - just steel manufacturing.
 - Created the largest U.S. American manufacturing company - U.S. Steel, the first company valued at a billion dollars.
- Can pre-industrial capitalism forms of government survive monpolistic market control and other industrial capitalism?

### Conditions of Labor
- The state was taking action to spur and advance industrial properties, not taking action to mitigate wealth inequality or thinking about redistributive efforts, **workers had no similar protections.**
- No protection in terms of working conditions.
 - 35,000 people were being killed in industrial accidents in workplaces every year; growth of factories geared towards profit maximization are not considering the human conditions of poeple doing the work.
  - Every industry faces horrifying industrial accidents; collapsed mines, steel explosions, brakemen, etc.
  - Furthermore, if you are incapacitated, there are few resources available.
- No protection in terms of consumers and living standards.
 - No oversight regulation standardization guarantees of living conditions; lack of proper ventilation, for example.
 - The law of competitiont hat applies to industrial development also applies to wages, which were continually low.
 - During periods of increased competition, wages would be pushed down even further.
- Often whole families would need to work; men had the highest standard of wage, women had lower pay even if doing similar work, and children had even lower pay.
 - The standard consensus was to make children useful, and it would be thus routine to see them working.
 - Children are put to work, and the families need the wages.
