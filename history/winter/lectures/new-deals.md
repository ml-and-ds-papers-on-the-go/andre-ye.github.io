### Introduction
- Diego Rivera, *Man at the Crossroads*, 1933
- Large transformations to the economy and state in the 1930s.
  - Central Questions: What caused the Great Depression? What factors led to the creation of the New Deal? Why was unionization successful during the Great Depression? Why was excluded from the reforms and why?
- New ideas in the wake of the Gilded Age:
  - Progressivism, Laissez Faire, Communism
  - Keynesian Economics and New Deal Liberalism
    - Not communism nor laissez-faire capitalism.
  - Economic Inequality in the 1920s
- The Great Depression
  - Keynesianism and the centrality of workers
  - Rise of industrial unionism (CIO)
    - Unions not only for the conditions of workers, but structural components to the U.S. government.
    - Unions emerged as an important part of Keynsianism.
  - New Deal and excluded groups
- The role of the state
  - Violence and repression: WWI and the Red Scare
  - Social safety net and social welfare?
  - New exclusions

- Cycles of economic boom and bust, as well as depressions.
  - Would cause panics in the stock market; bankruptices, depressions.

### Political Uses of WWI
- Comes to fruition in WWI; Progressive reforms at a national level are put into place politically.
- Before, the state of Oregon or a city like Chicago would pass a law, but there was no federal approach.
  - Remained in a Liberty of Contract position.
- WWI made questions of industrial stability part of the U.S. government's wartime interests.
  - Do not want disruptions during wartime production.

#### War Production
- The government regulates wartime production; guarantees industrial firms contracts, federal wages, and hour limitations.
- Other ancillary reforms are passed; votes for women passed (difficult to argue for fighting for democracy when women couldn't vote).

#### Espionage and Sedition Acts
- Many contradictions present.
- No anti-lynching legislation to mitigate and address white supremacist violence that was rampant.
  - NAACP had been pushing for it.
- Passage of the Espionage and Sedition Acts.
  - Sedition is about speech, and speaking out against U.S. military war aims.
  - Was used to prosecute a whole series of peoples; mostly people from the left.
    - These were most vocal in their opposition to the left.
  - The U.S. was also in opposition to war; many German immigrants were opposed to war against Germany.
    - A farmer said that what the U.S. did in the Philippines was worse than what Germany was doing.
    - Farmer was fined for speaking out.
  - Eugene Debs, went to a rally to support the farmer's right to speak, he was put in jail.
    - Debs ran for the presidency from jail.
  - Edward Snowden would be prosecuted under the Espionage and Sedition Acts.
- Had a deleterious effect on speech in the United States.

#### End of the War
- The war was partially ended by a series of revolts in European countries.
- 1917: U.S. gets involved in the war, but it began in 1914.
- Became the most devastating European conflict; presumed to be a quick war, but new military technologies emerged.
  - Gatling gun, chemical technologies, biological technologies.
  - Leads to horrifying brutality and carnage.
- Hundreds of thousands of soldiers being killed in single battles.
  - Battle of Verdun: 700k people killed.
  - No lines were moved forward, nothing changed.
- Eventually sparked revolt and revolutions in countries like Russia (peasant population revolted against the war), Germany (officials began refusing orders, brought the German imperial war machine to a close).

### Strike Wave: 1919
- Brought questions if the wartime protections would continue - were they permanent fixtures of the Ameircna poltiical economy?
