### Introduction
- Diego Rivera, *Man at the Crossroads*, 1933
  - Thinking only two ways forward: capitalistic system and communistic system.
- Large transformations to the economy and state in the 1930s.
  - Central Questions: What caused the Great Depression? What factors led to the creation of the New Deal? Why was unionization successful during the Great Depression? Why was excluded from the reforms and why?
- New ideas in the wake of the Gilded Age:
  - Progressivism, Laissez Faire, Communism
  - Keynesian Economics and New Deal Liberalism
    - Not communism nor laissez-faire capitalism.
  - Economic Inequality in the 1920s
- The Great Depression
  - Keynesianism and the centrality of workers
  - Rise of industrial unionism (CIO)
    - Unions not only for the conditions of workers but structural components to the U.S. government.
    - Unions emerged as an important part of Keynesianism.
  - New Deal and excluded groups
- The role of the state
  - Violence and repression: WWI and the Red Scare
  - Social safety net and social welfare?
  - New exclusions

<br>

---

<br>

### Class Violence and Class Warfare
- Ongoing and seemingly perpetual class violence occurred from the 1870s forward.
  - Ludlowe massacre: Rockefeller's mine interests against workers in a Colorado mine.
  - Italian anarchists tried and executed in 1927.
- Cycles of economic boom and bust, as well as depressions.
  - Would cause panic in the stock market; bankruptcies, depressions.
  
<br>

---

<br>

### Towards Progressivism
- Attempted to make conditions a little bit less horrid.
  - Prevented people under 14 from working; fire escapes, etc.

<br>

---

<br>

### Political Uses of WWI
- Comes to fruition in WWI; Progressive reforms at a national level are put into place politically.
- Before, the state of Oregon or a city like Chicago would pass a law, but there was no federal approach.
  - Remained in a Liberty of Contract position.
- WWI made questions of industrial stability part of the U.S. government's wartime interests.
  - Do not want disruptions during wartime production.

#### War Production
- The government regulates wartime production; guarantees industrial firms contracts, federal wages, and hour limitations.
- Other ancillary reforms are passed; votes for women passed (difficult to argue for fighting for democracy when women couldn't vote).
- War Production Board: a greater assertiveness for worker's rights

#### Espionage and Sedition Acts
- Many contradictions present.
- No anti-lynching legislation to mitigate and address white supremacist violence that was rampant.
  - NAACP had been pushing for it.
- Passage of the Espionage and Sedition Acts.
  - Sedition is about speech, and speaking out against U.S. military war aims.
  - Was used to prosecute a whole series of peoples; mostly people from the left.
    - These were most vocal in their opposition to the left.
  - The U.S. was also in opposition to war; many German immigrants were opposed to war against Germany.
    - A farmer said that what the U.S. did in the Philippines was worse than what Germany was doing.
    - Farmer was fined for speaking out.
  - Eugene Debs, went to a rally to support the farmer's right to speak, he was put in jail.
    - Debs ran for the presidency from jail.
  - Edward Snowden would be prosecuted under the Espionage and Sedition Acts.
- Had a deleterious effect on speech in the United States.

#### End of the War
- U.S. is involved for a relatively shorter period - about 16 months.
- The war was partially ended by a series of revolts in European countries.
- 1917: the U.S. gets involved in the war, but it began in 1914.
- Became the most devastating European conflict; presumed to be a quick war, but new military technologies emerged.
  - Gatling gun, chemical technologies, biological technologies.
  - Leads to horrifying brutality and carnage.
- Hundreds of thousands of soldiers being killed in single battles.
  - Battle of Verdun: 700k people killed.
  - No lines were moved forward, nothing changed.
- Eventually sparked revolt and revolutions in countries like Russia (peasant population revolted against the war), Germany (officials began refusing orders, brought the German imperial war machine to a close).

<br>

---

<br>

### Strike Wave: 1919
- Brought questions if the wartime protections would continue - were they permanent fixtures of the American political economy?
  - Will these wartime Progressive measures continue after the war?
- A series of national strikes in the U.S. and across Europe as well.
- Pushes these questions, arguing that these protections would continue.
- In Seattle, one of the first of a series of general strikes is experienced.
  - The entire city - all the unions and workers - strike at the same time.
  - Seattle as a city is struck down for a few days.
  - To avoid bloodshed, strike leaders back off after federal troops are called in.

#### Steel Strike
- Largest in the steel industry - upwards of 90% of steelworkers shut down the steel industry in 1919.
- Is eventually unsuccessful, because the strikers refused to let black workers into the unions.
- All of the strikes do not win or continue protections.

<br>

---

<br>

### Rise of Authoritarian Communism
- Many arguments against claims for protections were predicated on framing those claims as communistic.
- Up until this point, to be "left" meant to be anticapitalist.
  - Therefore, some socialist-anarchist or communist stripe.
  - In the early 20th century, the left had been the largest it had been up to this point.
- 1917: Russian revolution, which is a peasant revolt. Russia's population is ~90% agrarian.
  - The Bolsheviks - during the chaos - maneuver themselves through elections and seizing power to control the Russian government.
  - Led by Vladimir Lenin, represented a particular authoritarian strike of communism.
  - Most socialists and anarchists called themselves communist in that they imagined a stateless, socialized property.
    - Differences in how to get there: anarchists believed states could not be used to facilitate creating a communist society, socialists are defined by their statist beliefs.
    - Sanders believed you can win office in a capitalist society to transform the government into a more collective form of organization.
  - Communists believed that the capitalist government could be toppled and that a new government could be used to create a communist society.
- The Leninist Bolsheviks built upon this ideology; the state was to impose communism.
  - Not only is a revolution needed, but single-party control.

#### The Palmer Raids and the Red Scare
- This revolution led to a series of anti-communist scars in the rest of the Western world and fears the communist agitators and bogeymen were behind every discontent and strike.
- The revolt against Germany that ended the war was partially communist-inspired and revolutionary but was put down with violence.
- The strike wave in the United States also gets put down with violence in the merging violence in 1920-1921.
- Someone sends a bomb to the attorney general of the United States; Mitchell Palmer was the AG.
  - Police power of the executive is used to do a national sweep of leftists and radicals in the US, rounding them up and arresting them with sedition.
  - FBI emerges from this.
  - Highly disrupted to the organized left in the United States.
- Emma Goldman, the birth control advocate, and anarchist was detained and then reported.
- Was this regarded as Constitutional?
  - Absolute equality was intended, but... whatever, so went the reasoning.
- IWW would attempt to recruit union remembers by standing on street corners, and would get arrested for encouraging union membership.
- Famous free speech fights in Spokane, WA: passed an anti-criminal syndicalism law (could not talk about unions).
  - Lost the free-speech fight; courts would issue injunctions against unions for striking.
  - The kinds of constitutional protections we know today do not seem to be there.
- The Red Scare was highly successful in disrupting the left - those opposed to capitalism.

### Business Agenda in the 1920s
- Many of the labor movements and the Progressive wartime reforms were undone or hindered.
- The electoral terrain was shifted as it became much harder to run as a socialist or a leftist.
- There were hundreds of leftist mayors, council members, etc. that could not run easily again.
- What returned in eh the 1920s was a return in laissez-faire capitalism that occurred in the Gilded Age period.
- 1920s elections: Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover passed business-friendly legislation.
  - Idea that the state could be used to provide some protection to workers was undone.
  - Progressive-era reforms are undone.
- Ideology of Liberty as Contract returns and is generally held as a Constitutional standard.
- Idea of federal regulation of railroads or financial markets that the federal government had a responsibility to regulate financial markets - undone.
- A period of really expansive economic boom-times.

### Workers in the 1920s: Farm Foreclosures and Over-Saturated Consumer Markets
- "Roaring 20s" for the business sector in the U.S.
- Underneath this emerges real social crises, like **farming**.
- The U.S. agricultural industry boomed in the U.S. because it became the supply of food to all of Europe.
  - Europe's productive capacity is being destroyed; creates a new expansive market for U.S> agriculture.
- As the war ends and agricultural production in Europe returns, the U.S. begins to lose its demand despite producing enough food to feed the world.
  - In the 1920s, the price of food begins to collapse; are not even able to sell cost.
  - A spreading crisis of agricultural and framing crises across the MIdwest and places like California.
- The turn from yeoman family farm to mega-agribusiness occurs in this area.
  - Small farmers that had gotten homesteads are losing those farms and are bought by large agricultural firms.
- **Industrial workers** in the city have stagnant wages and are increasingly reliant on debt.
  - New mechanisms of commercial credit are created.
  - Purchase something on a payment plan for a refrigerator or a toaster.
  - Increasing debt burden.
- 1920s gives us a picture of a rapidly dividing wealth and income gap.

<br>

### The Crash of 1929
- Business is booming but the lower classes are being quashed.
- In October of 1929, the stock market crashes; the largest crash in history.
- Much of the speculative investment in Wall Street had run its course, and people realized they were investing in a whole lot of nothing.
- The market began to shrink, and people were afraid their asset values were diminishing, and the whole operation collapses.
- Banks became bankrupt in a day.
- No division between commercial banking vs investment banking; banks could take your savings into the stock market.
  - When the stock market collapsed and everyone was requesting funds; the banks could not provide money to account holders.
- Causality is similar to other boom/bust cycles.
- 1920s - many outrageous mechanisms.
  - Because of the growth of the 1920s stock market, a loan could be taken based on *future* earnings.
  - High-risk forms of investment are occurring.
- *lender of last resort* - one of the largest figures in the banking world, JP Morgan, began, as the market was collapsing, to buy everything.
  - Restored confidence in the market, and turned everything around.
  - Huge banking figures like Morgan should not be relied on; a system should be able to act as a lender of last resort.
  - Federal Reserve Bank - begin to lend money in times of crisis like this to ease the wheels.
- Outside of this, borrowing on future earnings is happening in the private sector; no policy for commercial bank trading.
- For four years after 1929, there is continual decline and erosion of the market and the rest of the economy.
  - The stock market loses *90%* of its value in a years-long decline.
  - Erosion of capital meant that banks weren't lending to business, but could not meet their month-to-month expenses.
  - Begin to lay off people; people that lay off are not buying things. Industrial firms face collapse and bankruptcy.
  - A cascade of a downward spiral; there appeared to be no solution. Would markets eventually hit a bottom and rebound? The search for the bottom ran apace.


<br>

<br>

### The People in the Great Depression
- The impacts on working people were devastating.
- There were not the same accounting numbers; it was very difficult to get a national picture of what unemployment looked like.
  - Estimated 25-30% of the entire country was unemployed.
- Industrial cities had upwards of 50% unemployment, or up to 60%.
- People could not pay rent or mortgage, so were evicted from housing and thrown on the street.
  - Normal agencies of relief - the "poor house" - meant philanthropic organizations, like churches that would run a soup kitchen or some other form of relief.
  - These funds come from donations, but the type of voluntaristic philanthropic aid of the Progressive era also gets wiped out.
- City governments cannot provide much aid either - they get their revenue from taxes.
  - Also facing bankruptcy.

#### Hoovervilles
- A series of homeless encampments in every industrial city, named after Herbert Hoover.
- President Hoover was elected in 1929 - sworn into office in March.
  - In October of 1929 is the stock market collapse; he thought it would be self-corrupting.
- Hoover would come out every few months and assure that the bottom was met. Waited for his entire term for a market solution - for which there wasn't one.

<br>

<br>

### 1932 Election of Roosevelt
- This leads to the 1932 presidential election. Hoover is resoundingly criticized and destroyed at the polls.
- FDR, a progressive Democrat, is elected into office; runs on a campaign promise of hope and change.
  - Does not give much policy prescription, but promises a system of national and economic relief.
- On this promise, he is elected.
- Looking at the conditions: families that were being malnourished throughout the crisis.

#### The First Hundred Days
- Begins a series of economic transformations.
- Some addressed economic conditions, like the AAA - Agricultural Adjustment Act.
  - Created a system where the government paid farmers not to produce, such that the stability of markets could be more predictable.
- Federal Banking Act - forces commercial and investment banks to separate.
- Pass the WPA, Worker's Progress Administration - a series of federal infrastructure programs.
  - Created road construction, engineering projects, high schools, parks, etc.
- Civilian Corps - putting many people to work
- These reforms are the New Deal - a hodgepodge of different emergency mechanisms.
- NIRA - National Industrial Recovery Agency

#### Keynesian Economics
- Concern of economic debt transformed Keynesianism.
- "Social democracy" - unexpected development of the 1930s.
- Until 1936, John Maynor Keynes published his general theory.
  - Economic orthodoxy was that budget shortfalls had to be addressed by cutting the budget.
  - Restrict expenditures - limit social spending such that things equalize when the markets recover.
- Keynes threw this out of the window: he pointed out that markets have flaws, many times they do not recover and market solutions are not possible.
  - Often rooted in psychology; in cases of market decline, if buyers are afraid or fearful that the market hasn't reached the bottom, even if they have money, they won't buy-in.
  - A prudent or fearful buyer will not buy anything.
  - Psychological factor was crucial for Keynes to explain why certain institutions could not be private and needed to address market failures.
  - Government did not need to live by indebtedness; they don't need to play by the rules.
- **Debt was to operate differently for the government.**
  - Public debt (debt from the government) is a debt we owe ourselves.
  - If a home owns a bank, it is external debt.
  - If it is the national debt, it is internal debt.
- Keynes' solution: governments can spend their way out of economic crisis and the economic ledgers don't matter if there is growth.
  - You could pay people to dig money, and throw money into the holes: at least it is putting money in the pockets of workers.
- Why was the economy suffering and struggling in the first place?
  - The model or exponential growth at the top is not a fundamentally sound economic structure.
  - Money at the button is a sound economic structure, but money in the hands of regular people and consumers such that they can spend and buy the abundance that capitalism is producing.
  - Need some redistributive mechanism in place; money siphoned to the very top of society, speculated through the financial system,m redistributed to consumers that can spend it on industrial goods and commercial products.
- Firms become sound financial industry again; a positive cycle.
- Economic thinking was something of a revolution, attempting to address the situation that the U.S. found itself in.

<br>

### Section 7a and the Unions
- How can the money be distributed? How should Keynesianism be implemented?
  - One can just taxa directly redistributive mechanism in the government.
    - Tax the rich over a certain benchmark of wealth and spend it on public services or give tax credits, no-interest loans, etc. to working people.
  - However, like a good Lockean system, such a directly redistributive mechanism will not be implemented.
- One could empower unions to do structural work in the economy.
  - Unions can play this role; the government is not involved, but they can legislate and legally protect working-class organizations tasked with raising the standard of living with working-class people.
- The FDR passes the NIRA - National Industrial Recovery Agency - whose law, Section 7a, legislated in favor of legally recognizing unions for the first time.
  - If workers had a free, influenced election vote to have a union, employers needed to negotiate with them.
  - This is ruled unconstitutional, and there is a court-packing fight.
- The Wagner Act is later passed.
  - The identical court members that ruled the NRA unconstitutional later pass the Wagner Act.
  - Roosevelt threatened to pack the court.

## Labor's Great Upheaval
- 3 general strikes in 1934 around wages getting cut off, conflict, striking, the police are called in, violence ensued.
- Continues to be violent class conflict in Minneapolis, Toledo, all across the country.

#### San Francisco General Strike
- Dockworkers that unloaded goods off of ships (before containerization - not lifting with cranes - people need to go into a cargo hold and pick it up, then carry it off, very labor-intensive.
- No regular employment. The gig economy is a long-standing feature of industrial capitalism and dock workers were hired by the day.
  - Highly contingent labor, low conditions, and low pay.
- Workers are looking for union recognition and a hiring hall to address these issues.
  - Employers do not recognize it and there is a strike in SF.
  - Police kill 2 of the workers; there is a massive memorial march for the slain workers.
  - As the march turns into a general strike; all workers refused work unless one union was recognized in the city.
- Spreads to a coast-wide longshore strike - even to Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles.
  - Employers asked un the federal government to put down the strikes.
- Perkins - Secretary of Labor - forced the employers to bargain with the unions.
  - Justification for this entity of a union and legitimization, signifies federal support for the first time for this kind of union struggle.
  - Becomes coddled into law.

#### Congress of Industrial Organizations
- A whole series of strikes - the Flint Sitdown Strike, in the automobile industry.
- Instead of a strike, sat in on the industry and refused to allow strikebreakers to get in and work the machinery.
- Left employers in a difficult situation.

### With Babies and Banners: Story of the Women's Emergency Brigade Documentary
- Interviews with women who participated in the United Auto Workers sit-down.
- Winter season of 1937, one evening: the husband didn't come home for several days.
- Strike began at Fisher 1 - sent the women working there out of the plant.
  - The media were eager to say that there was sexual mingling, so women were asked to leave.

  - Men were suspicious.
  - Women received lots of hostility.
- GM had many people that tried to cause trouble, staffed with guns, etc.
- Bull Run - radio had announced that a riot had broken out and a revolutionary system was breaking out.
  - The populists drove down to gather to observe; the men were speaking to the people beyond the police lines.
  - The sound car was broadcasting to those people.
- Women broke through the lines - the police did not want to fire into the backs of unwound women, and this wound up the battle.
  - Born solidarity and a feeling that women were as capable and courageous as men.
- Within the next few days, all women who wanted to or could be involved were to arrive at the hall and to form a brigade.
  - Brigade was there to provide any support needed.
