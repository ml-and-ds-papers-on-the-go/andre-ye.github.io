### The Rise of Euoropean Fascism
- Italy and Germany.
- Fascism - some aspect of politically authoritarian society; a break from traditions of liberal individualism and rights.
- Capitalist democracies have the idea the property and individual rights are the purview of state protections.
- Fascist politics don't share this view. Property is more of a national issue.
- How does this collective get defined? Constructing a hierarchy of human value - some humans more valuable than others.
- 1922 Italy, following the dislocations in Italian society caused by failures of WWI.
- 1933 Germany, Nazis won representation in Germany's Parliament and gained state power.

### World War I
- 20 million people were killed, hundreds of thousands people killed in single instances. No progress in terms of advancing war agendas or remaking the war map.
- Carnage continues until the end of November 1918; years of people being sent to their deaths and economies being disrupted.
  - A brutal development.
  - Chemical warfare, tanks, greater and more efficient mechanisms of killing.

### Wave of Revolutions
- Germany lost not because the leaders surrendered, but because there was a massive revolution in Germany against the Kaiser.
- 1918 and 1919 revolution, sailors and soldiers began to refuse orders and going to their deaths.
  - Initial refusal sparks a full mutiny in the army that shuts down Germany's war effort.
- Mutiny spreads into a Communist-inspired workers' revolution in Germany.
  - Partially inspired by the 1917 Russian revolution.
- Germany can't maintain its war effort - it comes to the end and the Allies win.
- This revolution was later put down; the Communist leaders were assassinated by other Communist leaders and a bougeouis republic (Weimar Republic) remerges out of this conflict.
- **Terms of peace imposed upon Germany were onerous**; France and Great Britain lost significant parts of their economy and sought to redress those by having Germany pay for them.
  - 35 billion dollar war debt on Germany, in 1919 dollars - an enormous sum of money.
  - Germany would be paying that cost for the rest of the 20th century, at a time when they just went through a devastating war and their economy collapsed.
- Government began to print more and more money - massive inflation occurs.
  - 1922 - Deustchmark is worth about 1/300 US dollars. By the end of 1922, it is worth about 1/7400; the next year, it is worth about 1/1b.
  - A massive inflationary crisis in the German republic in the 1920s, leading to an economic crisis.
- Other Western powers said that they wouldn't accept payments of worthless money - instead, they would sieze the industrial factories and pay themselves in product outputs.
  - Get a coal mine and pay themselves in coal.
  - Imposed further German deprivation on the German economy; they were suffering harsh economic deprivation throughout the 1920s.
  - This inflation crisis occurs in 1923, '24 - the currency begins to stabilized by the end of the decade.
  - In 1929, a global economic depression tanks the economy yet again.

### Rise of the Nazi Party
- In this context, the Nazi party comes to power.
- 1933 - the party wins a plurality of the German Parliament.
  - Not a winner-take all two-party system, but many-party proportional representation.
- With a 30% vote, the Nazi party was the largest party in the German Parliament and hence the dominating party.
- A whole series of political calcualtions that people made.
  - Were Hitler and the Nazis one-trick ponies? Hitler was able to use extra electoral power to attack other political parties.
- Nazi's party came from organizing disaffected German citizens and war veterans that had sacrificed a lot for war and returned to a country completely fallen apart.
- Organize these into paramilitary forces associated with the *party*, not the govrnment, that could physically attack and disrupt other political organizations.
- Largest party by membership was the socialist party, then the communist party - the Nazis would send these "brownshirts" to physically attack and kill other party members.
- Staged an abortive coup early in 1924, attempted to sieze power through a coup by extralegal means; are defeated and stopped, Hitler is arrested and sent in prison.
- Hitler writes Mein Kampf in prison and becomes a fundamental document for the Nazi ethos.
- The party had a paramilitary wing using violence but also refined the Nazi ethos and appeal.
  - To the soldiers and unemployed: the economic crises of the nation is the result of the failures and betrayals of leftists and Jews.
  - Germany could have won World War I, they argued, if not by Communists that staged a 1919 revolution.
    - The tradition of German greatness had been sabatoged by these leftists that had betrayed the country.
  - According to common anti-Semetic tropes in Europe, Jewish people were argued to have controlled the banking industry.
    - Price inflation and currency devaluation was argued to be the result of the secret Jewish bankers, secretly profiting while everyone else suffered.
  - Jews were also argued to be radicals as well - behind Communist plots.
- Jews and the left were argued to pose a serious threat to German national greatness.

#### Nazi Political Economy
- A series of crises through which Hitler uses the crises to declare a state of national emergency; uses the state power to attack rival political parties, beginning with the Communists.
- Communists are put into detention centers that are the forebearer to much larger concentration camps.
- The Nazi party is able to maintain party throught he 1930s; develop a political economy meant to rectify the crises of the '30s.
- Do this through greater state intervention and to questions of economy priority.
  - Using the state to facilitate economic growth and profitability.
  - Increased militarism.
- Even though the Treaty of Versailles disallowed German military development, Germawny did it initially on the sly, then in the open - arguing it would revive the economy.  
  - Somewhat successful, to some degree.
- Not just empty promises and racial stereotypes that the German political economy was offering.
- This economic and military growth led to a policy of "living room", the German "living space".
- Germans needed greater mobility, access to resources. Had somewhat legitimate claims to resieze territory.
- The Western powers siezed factory production, Sudetenland, etc. which were claimed to be legitimate *German* territories.
- The economy is being revived through military industries being used to sieze sets of territories, which later became claims to entire countries - like Austria.
  - Austria, as a German-speaking country, was argued to be part of Germany.
- While mostly tolerated by other countries, German crossed the red line in 1939, when the Nazis invaded Poland.
  - Initiation of defenses by the Soviet Union.
  - The rest of Europe follows suit, causing the second World War.

### Ghettos to Concentration Camps
- 1930s - eliminating political opposition, developing a system of racial hierarchy that was based on U.S. Jim Crow segregation.
- The idea that racial minorities should not have full and equal passing rights, or should live in particular neighborhoods or areas, confined to certain ethnic ghettos.
  - Came from U.S. practice of segregation; in the German case Jews face a more stirngent set of restrictions around owning property, purchasing things, having to wear public symbols to identify themselves as Jews, etc.
- This policy of confinement becomes a policy of extermination.
- Concentration camps transformed into death factories; a significant number of people were killed in these concentration camps.
  - An equal number were killed by death squads that the Nazis would send into far-field rural cities.
  - Many Jewish communities were isolated and rural; shooting communities of Jews.
  - Developed into the Holocaust.

### U.S.-Soviet Alliance
- Nazi Germany invaded Poland and goes to war against Britain and France.
- When the United States' territory is bombed in 1941 by Japan, U.S. enters the war and is in alliance with the Soviet Union in 1941.
- France is overrun by the Nazis into 1940, the country is divided between a Nazi government in the North and a resistance government in the South.
- Britain is suffering nightly air raids; is having a hard time fighting back against hte military might and accumen of the Nazi government.
- Soviet Union and the United States emerge as the two main industrial powwers able to counter Nazi military might.
- Much of the U.S. war effort taken on individually is in the Pacific, which alleviated Soviet Resources to fight Nazis in the European field.
- Allied Powers refrained from getting heavily involved in Europe until fairly late with the D-Day invasion.

### War's End in Europe
- Soviet Union bears the brunt of fighting in World War II, are continually losing until the battle of Stalingrad in 1944.
- Nazis push against the entire Western expanse of the Soviet Union till Moscow until a brutal battle in which over a million soldiers are killed in the battle of Stalingrad.
- Nazi forces are pushed back and Berlin is take in the spring of 1945.
- The Allied forces that invaded France in the D-Day landing, headed by future president Dwight Eisenhower, refrain from marching to Berlin and allow the Soviets to do so.
- The Death Toll is devastating for the Soviets; more than half of the military deaths are by Soviet soldiers.

### War in the Pacific
- China was a country in crisis because Western colonialism had left it quite impoverished; was suffering a series of social cataclysms including revolutionary movements of multiple types.
  - Japan invades China and has been on a process of industrial development since the late 1900s forward.
  - Have a political system that is based on recognition of an emporer and military prowess.
  - This led to Japanese expansion in the 1920s and 30s into the invasion of China - Manchuria, in particular.
  - Under which, there is a social revolution happening in an attempt to fight off against this occupation.
  - Many of the Chinese deaths come from this Japanese invasion.
- The United States is fighting in the Pacific largely on its own against Japan; the majority of U.S. war deaths come from this.
- The war was particularly brutal and devastating; much of embittered fighting in the Pacific.
- Not traditional troop movements as in Europe, but siezing islands and such to advance in the Pacific.
- Japan is knowing it is losing and U.S. planners are looking for peace - conditional or unconditional, terms, etc.
  - Planning a full-scale invasion when the developments of the Manhattan project come to fruition in the Spring and Summer of 1945.
  - Franklin Delano Roosevelt dies in his fourth term in office; his vice president Harry Truman takes over the presidency.
  - Very quickly, decide to use nuclear weapons against two cities - Hiroshoma on August 6th, 1945 and then Nagasaki on August 8th, 1945.
- Development of atomic weapons were significant in a variety of ways, certainly for what they signify in temrs of the destructive capability of industrial societies.

#### Victory
- Ends in victory for the Allies, but the continent of Europe is destroyed; Germany, Great Britain, and France are devastated.
- Hard to call this a victory; one of the most devastating and horrific events in human history.
- These developments haunt the human pysche in the a) Holocaust and b) the develoopment of nuclear weapons.

### Decolonization
- European empires had been significantly disrupted; their ability to maintain their imperial conrol of much of the rest of the globe was eradicated; in the aftermath of the war, their move around decolonization in a whole series of countries emerges.
  - Most sginificantly, in the independence of Pakistan and India; Greeat Britain is no longer able to control Indian politics and a nationalist movement emerges.
  - England gives up its most economically profitable colony.
- The United States gives up the Philipines in 1946, starting a whole chain fo anticolonial movement that are won - some easier than others, for instnace in Angola and the Congo against Dutch Rule.
