### The Rise of Euoropean Fascism
- Italy and Germany.
- Fascism - some aspect of politically authoritarian society; a break from traditions of liberal individualism and rights.
- Capitalist democracies have the idea the property and individual rights are the purview of state protections.
- Fascist politics don't share this view. Property is more of a national issue.
- How does this collective get defined? Constructing a hierarchy of human value - some humans more valuable than others.
- 1922 Italy, following the dislocations in Italian society caused by failures of WWI.
- 1933 Germany, Nazis won representation in Germany's Parliament and gained state power.

### World War I
- 20 million people were killed, hundreds of thousands people killed in single instances. No progress in terms of advancing war agendas or remaking the war map.
- Carnage continues until the end of November 1918; years of people being sent to their deaths and economies being disrupted.
  - A brutal development.
  - Chemical warfare, tanks, greater and more efficient mechanisms of killing.

### Wave of Revolutions
- Germany lost not because the leaders surrendered, but because there was a massive revolution in Germany against the Kaiser.
- 1918 and 1919 revolution, sailors and soldiers began to refuse orders and going to their deaths.
  - Initial refusal sparks a full mutiny in the army that shuts down Germany's war effort.
- Mutiny spreads into a Communist-inspired workers' revolution in Germany.
  - Partially inspired by the 1917 Russian revolution.
- Germany can't maintain its war effort - it comes to the end and the Allies win.
- This revolution was later put down; the Communist leaders were assassinated by other Communist leaders and a bougeouis republic (Weimar Republic) remerges out of this conflict.
- **Terms of peace imposed upon Germany were onerous**; France and Great Britain lost significant parts of their economy and sought to redress those by having Germany pay for them.
  - 35 billion dollar war debt on Germany, in 1919 dollars - an enormous sum of money.
  - Germany would be paying that cost for the rest of the 20th century, at a time when they just went through a devastating war and their economy collapsed.
- Government began to print more and more money - massive inflation occurs.
  - 1922 - Deustchmark is worth about 1/300 US dollars. By the end of 1922, it is worth about 1/7400; the next year, it is worth about 1/1b.
  - A massive inflationary crisis in the German republic in the 1920s, leading to an economic crisis.
- Other Western powers said that they wouldn't accept payments of worthless money - instead, they would sieze the industrial factories and pay themselves in product outputs.
  - Get a coal mine and pay themselves in coal.
  - Imposed further German deprivation on the German economy; they were suffering harsh economic deprivation throughout the 1920s.
  - This inflation crisis occurs in 1923, '24 - the currency begins to stabilized by the end of the decade.
  - In 1929, a global economic depression tanks the economy yet again.
