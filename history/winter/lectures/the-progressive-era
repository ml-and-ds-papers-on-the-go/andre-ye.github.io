### Introduction
- Introductory art: George Bellows, *New York*, 1911.
  - An emphasis on light; buildings are illuminated across the plaza.
  - What is it like to be in a city in which massive skyscrapers cause large shafts of light to jut out between buildings.
  - Expresses the optimism and hope of progressive development and urbanism; yet the chaotic mess and swirl of the modern urban world without structure and regulation.
- The Guilded Age was filled with class conflict and violence; perhaps these tensions should be mitigated.
- **Contrast notions of "progress" at the turn of the century**
  - Central Questions: What factors make rpogressive social change possible? What is "progressie" social change? How important is social history, intellectual history, race, and class to understand the proigressive era?
  - Jim Crow in American society
    - Jim Crow was slowly built over decades of rolling back black political empowerment, and constructing and reinforcing white supremacy in law.
    - Entrenched racial segregation and racial conceptions of progressivism.
  - The Social Question, socialism, and Progressivism
    - Tensions of class, immigration, and ethnic identity from the Gilded Age  spilled into the 20th century.
    - Progressivism was the response to tensions of the Gilded Age.
  - Women's movement in the early century
    - Referred to the "first wave" of feminists.
    - Women after 70 years of social ovement organizing, began to win major legislative victories.
  - Lecture will focus on race, gender, and class in the Progressivist movement.
