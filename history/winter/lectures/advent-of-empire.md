### Introduction
- Miss Columbia's School House, 1894.
  - How is the "education" going?
  - Depicts internal borders and the process of immigration: it is going quite poorly.
  - Can be read as an anti-imperialist or anti-expansionist message, as the U.S. considers bringing in new territories: *is it possible?*
- **Central Questions:** Why Empire? What drove U.S. imperial expansion in the 19th and 20th centuries? What is the relationship of economic factors, ideology, race, state power, and violence in U.S. expansion?
  - U.S. origins are founded in the Concept of Empire
    - Thomas Jefferson and the Empire of Liberty
    - Conquest of Native Lands up to 1890
  - Economic Expansions and the Quest for New Markets
    - The Spanish American War
  - America's Race Thinking and the Problem of Exclusions
    - International Component - Conquest of New Lands and Open Door Policy
    - Domestic Component - who is fit for civilization?
  - Resistance to War and Imperialism
    - "War is the Health of the State"

### The Spanish American War
- 1898; a turning point historians seek to in trying to explain American imperialism; anticolonial struggles that the United States stepped into.
- Seen as the "moment" of the development.
  - It's important to be grounded in what this is.
- By the 1890s, the Spanish Empire (founded with conquest) is collapsing, in a free fall.
  - A series of nationalist revolutions all throughout the Spanish empire.
  - Created several independent countries - Mexico, Venezuela, Bolivia, etc.
- A process of decolonization has been occuring, and the Spanish continue to hold some more important colonies - the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Cuba, etc.
  - No longer able to hold it.
  - Anti-colonial natioanal liberation movements emerge in all of their colonies, modelled on the American revolution from the 1790s.
- United States is depicted as protecting Cuba from the nasty Spanish conquerers (cartoon).
- Giving the U.S. the oppurtunity to think of itself as an expansionist nation.

### Empire of Liberty?
- The United States invades Cuba and the Philippines - seen as a major transformative point?
  - Some historicans have begun questioning that point.
- Jefferson writes to the revolutionary army; writes that it's important colonials access the fort because we're trying to establish an *empire of liberty*.
  - Not a monarchist and oppressive government like the British, but an expansion based on democracy and liberty.
  - A beacon of freedom rather than one of oppression and tyranny.
- Opening up the American continent for settlement; justified with the conception of Emprie of Liberty.
  - Concieved as a contest between European empires.
  - A process of territorial expansion into foreign-held space and violence with a self-conception of *empire*.
- *What has changed, what is significant about what is happening in the 1890s?*

#### Battle of Wounded Knee
- "The Closing of the American Frontier"
- The notion of territorial expansion across the continent is being closed as the government militarily conquers this space.
  - "Pacifies" indigenious resistance to American expansion.
- 1890 Battle; the U.S. switches its policies from Indian Removal (pushing indigenious people into territories) to Reservation (creating reserves for indigenious people to live on).
- Pursuing this policy at a time when plains Indians develop a "ghost dance" process.
  - A lament, memorial to all of the indigenious peoples that have been killed and died through these hundred-years of conquest.
  - Also a messianic quality; by enacting the ghost dance, plains people would come together for rituals and call forth a Messiah.
  - All of those lost peoples would come forth and be present, to create a moment that would stop the advance of white settlers; to create a new-formed indigenious society.
- The U.S. didn't like this process, because it brought people from all regions together, disrupting the reservation process; furthermore, conflicting political overtones.
  - U.S. attempted to stop the process of the dance.
  - Come to arrest the Lakota Sioux chief, Sitting Bull.
  - Arrive at an encampment to sieze and arrest Sitting Bull.
  - In a conflict, there is shooting and Sitting Bull is killed in that arrest attempt.
- The hundreds of Sioux that are in the encampment flee, where the American army pursues them; catches up to them at Wounded Knee Creek
  - In the middle of Winter, proceed to halt the fleeing people.
  - The American army opens up on the fleeing people, killing everyone.
  - Very few survivors escaped.
- "The end of the ghost dance".

### American Progress
- Closing the continental expansion - the United States has militarily secured the portion of the N.A. continent it claimed from indigenious resistance.
  - Is this a change or a shift?
  - Perhaps; is this an advent of something *new*?
- The use of violence and force was used to secure territory for government settlement.
- *American Progress*.
  - Lockean justification for expansion.
- Some violence is underpinning this process; how are things being enacted?

### Economic Crises
- If anything was different - looking for continuity - it is the development of industrial capitalism, and the advent of a series of economic crises.
  - Punctuated every decade.
- Ex.
  - Depression of 1873
  - Depression of 1886
  - Depression of 1893
    - By far the worst depression; 500 Wall Street firms and banks closed, 15000 closed businesses, farms that have to shut down.
    - Unemployment rate as high as 25%; in Michigan at 40%.
    - A dramatic economic crisis that contributes to social crises and questions.
  - Cycle of boom & bust continues; an important part of thinking about how other state planners are thinking about military expansion.
- Crisis of overcompetition or ruinous competition.
- Economists and state planners thought of these crises as *overtapped markets* that could not consume the volume of goods that the American economy was producing.
  - There is a new industrial process; it's producing way more canned goods but the American people are not consuming enough.
  - Thinking: there can be ways to solve this boom/bust cycle, evening out the markets if a constant way to expand into new markets was found.
- By expanding into new markets (i.e. not only sell to New England but the entire Eastern seaboard, or the entire continent and overseas), boom/bust cycles could be ended and new production be satisfied.

### War and Business
- Indigenious scholars bring the question of continuity to analyzing Empire.
- What about thinking about expansion in the context of the Guilded Age; were businesspeople continuously thinking about how to access new markets?
  - Levelling out dramatic market spikes and drops.
- This was the defining decision point for figures like McKinley to opt for war; economic depression and drive for business interest to get access to new markets and goods.
  - Interests in Cuba are mostly commercial.
  - U.S. heavily involved in the Cuban sugar market

### Foreign Conquest: Spanish American War
- Incident in Havana harbor in which a U.S. ship explodes; this is taken by the media as an attack by Spain.
  - Likely to actually be the result of a boiler explosion.
- Used to argue that the United States was under attack.
- Secretary of State John Hay - a "splendid little war".
  - Few casualties and almost complete victory, attempting to "facilitate Cuban national independence".
    - Cuba *did* become a nominally independent country in that it had its own Constitution and laws.
  - However, the United States was heavily involved in the process; required the Cuban Constitution have certain sets of provisions.
- Required provisions in the Constitution:
  - Ensuring American access to a naval base in Cuba
  - Cuba must allow American military intervention unilaterally
  - Treaty of Commercial Reciprocity; removed tariff restrictions on goods coming into the islands.
  - Reciprocal relationship for the export of sugar.
- Result: America owns the majority of Cuba's sugar exports' Cuba remains a monocrop economy after Spanish rule but exports to America.

### Occupation of the Philippines
- Invasion of the Philippines was not; it was a protracted guerilla conflict.
- Part of a much longer nationalist struggle against colonial rule; a series of leaders like Emilio Aguinaldo - nationalist figures.
- Came to the United States seeking aid, but became clear as the U.S. became involved that it would not allow the Philippines independence but was seeking to have a more dominant, imperialist relationship.
- The nationalist movement came from fighting Spanish occupation to fighting U.S. occupation.
- 1898-1903; 5 years' turn. As many as 100k Filipinos and 4.5k Americans are killed.
- An *insurgency* - armies cannot fight toe-to-toe with an industrial empire, so they use guerrila tactics (surprise, traps, knowledge of terrain).
  - Filipino armies would gain support from locals that would give food, shelter, etc. in support of a national insurgency movement.
- THe United States engaged in counter-insurgency methods; torture tactics to gain information, etc.
  - Chinese water cure - simulated drowning, pouring water over someone's face to make them feel like they will suffocate.
  - Hamlet operations; displacing operations, removing villages, ending chain of aid and support going to the insurgency.
  - When people resisted, they were chased down and killed.
    - Massacre at Moro Bay; American army pursues and opens up militarily on Filipinos - as many as 1800 people.

### U.S. Imperialism and Anti-Imperialism
- Many saw this as a break, a change from what the United States had practiced in the past.
- What did this type of imperialism mean for the character of the nation? - for the United States to be making rather brutal military tactics to be controlling very far-flung and different territories?
- Could the United States *as a republic* survive an advent of empire?
  - Can internal democratic practices survive force and authority required?
  - What happens to the conquered people?
    - Can savage people be participants in a republican form of government.
- Those in favor of military intervention stated: yes, the process is to uplift and civilize "our little brown brothers" (McKinley).
  - Taft: "to teach Anglo-Saxon liberty"
  - A disequilibrium that can nevertheless be overcome.

### Racial Constructions During War Time
- After the capture of the Philippines in the Battle of Manila; were ready to declare victory.
- "Expansion, Before and After" - *The Boston Sunday Globe*.
  - A *necessity* for transformation.
- Race, in addition to continental expansion and commerce, is a fundamental justification both for and against forms of imperial expansion.
